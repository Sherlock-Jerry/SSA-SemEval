but the staff was so horrible to us .
to be completely fair , the only red ##eem ##ing factor was the food , which was above average , but could n ##' ##t make up for all the other def ##iciencies of te ##od ##ora .
the food is uniformly exceptional , with a very capable kitchen which will proudly whip up whatever you feel like eating , whether it ' ##s on the menu or not .
our agreed favorite is the orr ##ech ##ie ##te with sausage and chicken ( usually the waiter ##s are kind enough to split the dish in half so you get to sample both meat ##s ) .
the bag ##els have an outstanding taste with a terrific texture , both chew ##y yet not gum ##my .
nevertheless the food itself is pretty good .
they did not have mayo ##nna ##ise , forgot our toast , left out ingredients ( ie cheese in an om ##ele ##t ) , below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it cr ##umble ##d on the plate when you touched it .
the design and atmosphere is just as good .
the seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches .
my suggestion is to eat family style because you ' ##ll want to try the other dishes .
best of all is the warm vibe , the owner is super friendly and service is fast .
faa ##n ' ##s got a great concept but a little rough on the delivery .
from the incredible food , to the warm atmosphere , to the friendly service , this downtown neighborhood spot does n ##' ##t miss a beat .
great food at reasonable prices , makes for an evening that ca n ##' ##t be beat !
this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices .
two words : free wine .
the price is reasonable although the service is poor .
the quantity is also very good , you will come out satisfied .
the fried rice is amazing here .
three courses - choices include excellent mu ##ssel ##s , puff pastry goat cheese and salad with a delicious dressing , and a hang ##er steak au po ##iv ##re that is out of this world .
the place is so cool and the service is prompt and curt ##ious .
at the end you ' ##re left with a mild bro ##th with noodles that you can sl ##ur ##p out of a cup .
i just wonder how you can have such a delicious meal for such little money .
the wine list is excellent .
iv ##e been to many thai restaurants in manhattan before , and too ##ns is by far the best thai food iv ##e had ( except for my mom ' ##s of course ) .
this is a consistently great place to din ##e for lunch or dinner .
nice atmosphere , the service was very pleasant and the desert was good .
after really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a table and had dinner .
i liked the beer selection !
great food , good size menu , great service and an un ##pre ##ten ##tious setting .
wine list selection is good and wine ##- ##by ##- ##the ##- ##glass was generous ##ly filled to the top .
the menu is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 en ##tree ##s .
the menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent .
great bag ##els , spreads and a good place to hang out in .
unfortunately , the food is outstanding , but everything else about this restaurant is the pits .
we always have a delicious meal and always leave feeling satisfied .
first went here to enjoy their garden terrace .
the pizza was pretty good and huge .
the cuisine from what i ' ##ve gathered is authentic taiwanese , though its very different from what i ' ##ve been accustomed to in taipei .
i almost he ##sit ##itate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and i would hate for it too become to crowded .
they are often crowded on the weekends but they are efficient and accurate with their service .
the atmosphere is un ##her ##ald ##ed , the service imp ##ec ##cable , and the food mag ##ni ##fi ##can ##t .
we ordered the special , grille ##d bran ##zin ##o , that was so infused with bone , it was difficult to eat .
right off the l in brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza .
le pere pin ##ard has a $ 15 pre ##- ##the ##ater menu that is outstanding .
the strong scents coming from the left and right of me negatively affected my taste buds .
we had the lobster sandwich and it was fantastic .
though the spider roll may look like a challenge to eat , with soft shell crab hanging out of the roll , it is well worth the price you pay for them .
deep fried sk ##ew ##ers are good and still rare to find in nyc .
i also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of cong ##ee ( rice por ##ridge ) .
their tuna tar ##tar app ##eti ##zer is to die for .
an oasis of ref ##ine ##ment : food , though somewhat uneven , often reaches the pinnacle ##s of new american fine cuisine - chef ' ##s passion ( and kitchen ' ##s precise execution ) is most evident in the fish dishes and soup ##s .
if you love wine and cheese and delicious french fare , you ' ##ll love art ##isan ##al !
i love indian food and consider myself to be quite an expert on it .
the lava cake dessert was incredible and i recommend it .
from the terrible service , to the bland food , not to mention the una ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting managers , the overall experience was horrible .
lahore is a great place to duck into late ##- ##night when you need some really ta ##sty food on the cheap - ##- you ' ##ll likely have trouble finishing the amount of food you get for four dollars .
good selection of wines ranging from affordable to high end .
nice restaurant overall , with classic upscale italian decor .
not impressed with the food .
the entire dining experience was wonderful !
the wine selection ( by the glass and bottle ) is wonderful and i always recommend that friends make a reservation if they ' ##re going to be in town .
order the pan ##ang duck , it ' ##s fantastic .
food is usually very good , though o ##cas ##ional ##ly i wondered about fresh ##mes ##s of raw vega ##table ##s in side orders .
other than the crap ##py service from two individuals , it ' ##s great .
they have authentic indian at ama ##zin prices .
am ##bian ##ce - ##- relaxed and st ##yl ##ish .
yes , they use fancy ingredients , but even fancy ingredients do n ##' ##t make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right .
and yes dal bu ##khar ##a is so dam good and so are all the ka ##ba ##bs .
i look forward to eating here again
tu ##k tu ##k is one of those comfortable neighborhood joints where you know you will always have a good meal at a fair price .
a glass of leaping lizard , a glass of prose ##cco , and the mu ##ssel ##s had everything happy .
food was average and cr ##eme br ##ule ##e was awful - the sugar was charred , not cara ##mel ##ized and smelled of ke ##rose ##ne .
the food always tastes fresh and served promptly .
the pizza here is delicious .
this place is really trend ##i but they have forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant , the food .
hats off to the chef .
the pizza is delicious - they use fresh mo ##zza ##rella instead of the cheap , frozen , shredded cheese common to most pizza ##ria ' ##s .
its an excellent place to relax and the food is one of the best in the city of new york .
service is friendly , and never had a problem walking in and getting a table .
the atmosphere was crowded but it was a great bis ##tro ##- ##type vibe .
first off , the waitress was completely una ##tten ##tive the 2 times we saw her ( odd in a restaurant with 6 tables ) and got our order wrong .
the food was bland oil ##y .
what is even better , is that the prices are very affordable as well , and the food is really good .
the fish is fresh but the variety of fish is nothing out of ordinary .
our favorite meal is a pest ##o pizza , the house salad , and a good bottle of wine .
am ##bian ##ce and music funky , which i enjoy .
the food , drinks and service are clearly among the best in the city .
granted the space is smaller than most , it is the best service you will find in even the largest of restaurants .
i love the atm ##or ##pher ##e @ pee ##p !
the service was at ##ten ##tive and her suggestions of menu items was right on the mark .
the other night we had the $ 30 three course meal and everything was delicious - if i could of licked the plate clean i would of .
even after getting pushed out by the no ##- ##class famous ray ' ##s , sal has risen again to carry on his father ' ##s uncle ' ##s leg ##acies with a smile , true love for his community , and let ' ##s not forget the outstanding pizza !
the environment is romantic , but the food is horrible , the service is pathetic , and gabriel ##la lies about everything she could .
we had cr ##aw ##fish boiled and despite making a mess , it was a ton of fun and quite ta ##sty as well .
what came to our table was burned beyond recognition and string ##y .
i had the pad thai and the noodles were sticky .
the hostess is rude to the point of being offensive .
if you ' ##re craving for ha ##ru ' ##s great food , especially the house roll , but ca n ##' ##t stand the wait building out ##is ##de , head across the street to their sake bar !
a narrow corridor leads to a tiny space where there are three tiny white tiled counters , a great deal of mess ( stacks of bottles , cans ) and a small counter holding 12 ##- ##14 en ##tree ##s .
the food is great .
all convenient ##ly delivered right to the door .
i also ordered the change mo ##jit ##o , which was out of this world .
okay service .
the only thing more wonderful than the food ( which is exceptional ) is the service .
the anti ##- ##pas ##ta was excellent , especially the cal ##ama ##ri , as were the filling pasta main ##s .
the waitress suggested glasses of wine that went very well with the food .
they might be all business at the counter when you give your order , but their food says i love you .
we are very particular about su ##shi and were both please with every choice which included : ce ##vich ##e mix ( special ) , crab dump ##lings , ass ##orted sash ##imi , su ##shi and rolls , two types of sake , and the banana te ##mp ##ura .
good luck getting a table .
the take ##out menu says to keep an eye out for an expanded menu offering more italian dishes , i ca n ##' ##t wait !
the pizza is good though .
bottles of wine are cheap and good .
the have over 100 different beers to offer th ##ier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious , if i must recommend a dish it must be the pu ##m ##kin tor ##tel ##ini .
you must have the crab ##me ##at las ##ag ##na which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert .
very good service and very good prices .
the service was imp ##ec ##cable and uno ##bt ##rus ##ive - ##- the staff knows what they are there to do - ##- to know their menu , present your meal , and attend to your needs .
our food was great too !
the most annoying thing , though , is the fact that the servers seem to be trained to drive revenue .
please try the file ##t mig ##non , its just the most tender piece ever .
the drinks are amazing and half off till 8 ##pm .
i ' ##ve been back to nh ##a tran ##g literally a hundred times for the beef cube ##s - they ' ##re that good .
we were seated promptly as we had reservations , however after that the service was slow .
the food was pretty good , but a little flavor ##less and the portions very small , including dessert .
lived in shanghai most of my life and thought the food was comparable to the flagship green bo restaurant there .
i highly recommend cafe st ##. bart ' ##s for their food , the am ##bie ##nce and wonderful service .
all the nyu students love this place so it makes for a fun young atmosphere .
the food here does a great service to the name ( cantonese that is ... ) .
but , nothing stands out about the cooking .
joy ##a used to be a cool spot with decent food and a colorful - if not relaxed - atmosphere .
the prix fix ##e menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough ( both in quantity and quality ) .
i work near ##- ##by , and they have the best o ##at ##me ##al in the neighborhood ##- not a packaged or quick ##- ##co ##oked item .
too bad the food was n ##' ##t of the same heritage .
the menu looked good , except for offering the chilean sea bass , but the server does not offer up the specials that were written on the board outside .
since it literally is a complete hole in the wall , it ' ##s a bit intimidating at first , but you get over that very quickly as soon as the friendly staff welcome ##s you - do n ##' ##t hesitate to ask for help with what to get .
when he finally did , he was unable to make a gin and tonic - ##- could n ##' ##t find tonic .
the dim sum is ok but does n ##' ##t taste that fresh , and the little dishes do n ##' ##t look steam ##y hot as they should ( also note lack of chinese here ) .
the service is ok , some of the people did n ##' ##t get what they asked for .
if you want good authentic thai this place is not the place to go .
i recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one .
staff is very acc ##omo ##dating .
very popular style i ##zak ##aya ( sake and small portion of sake ##- ##fr ##ien ##dly dishes ) .
the food was terrific and the service class ##y , at ##ten ##tive , without being over ##be ##aring .
this is an amazing place to try some rot ##i rolls .
fresh ingredients and everything is made to order .
we have never had any problems with charging the meal or the tip , and the food was delivered quickly , but we live only a few minutes walk from them .
quick and friendly service .
try the hot dogs too , they ' ##re snap ##py and delicious .
the noise level was unbearable , conversation impossible .
personal pan ##s are the perfect size for those hungry nights .
highly recommended is the spicy fried cl ##am rolls and spider rolls .
one of the earlier people commenting on the restaurant did not get the that some experimenting is going on with the menu in a positive way .
odd for ave b , not just odd , the place attracts an eclectic crowd to say the least .
just got back from lunch at tam ##ari ##nd and it was excellent .
head and shoulders above its ne ##igh ##bo ##ors on east 6 st , ta ##j mahal is also very comparable , in food quality , to the much over ##pr ##ais ##ed ( and under ##des ##erving ) bal ##uchi ' ##s .
as we were sitting eating the sub ##par food the manager proceeded to be ##rate a couple of his employees for putting out the wrong containers for con ##diment ##s and explained to them how expensive these containers were .
great indian food and the service is incredible .
decor is nice and minimal ##ist , food simple yet very well presented and cooked , and the wine list matches the food very well .
we ordered a tuna melt - it came with out cheese which just made it a tuna sandwich .
the waiter ##s were not at ##ten ##tive except that the bill turned up on the table before we were finished .
the sang ##ria was pretty ta ##sty and good on a hot mug ##gy day .
for the people who want great food plus great service , roxy is a place to avoid !
i had the best ravi ##oli ever .
iv ##e been here a bunch of times now and the service is always outstanding .
quite frankly , this is some of the worst su ##shi i have ever tried .
the food is great , service is ok .
spice is great thai food , love the inexpensive app ##eti ##zers .
the service was at ##ten ##tive .
he not only makes his own homemade mo ##zza ##rella , but every pie is ultra fresh .
fish was over ##don ##e .
when you ' ##re sitting in their main dining room ( which has a spectacular , hand ##- ##pa ##int ##ed high ceiling ) you ' ##d never know there was a world outside .
we visited bread bar during january restaurant week and were so pleased with the menu selections and service .
also make sure you pay attention to the music being pipe ##d in - quite a weird selection .
the establishment scores big points in presentation and style .
the wait staff is very friendly , if not overly efficient .
the dim sum however was very good .
service has always been friendly and efficient .
all we received was an apology as we left to see our show without dinner .
the table next to us asked if he crushed the grapes himself when their long over ##due bottle of wine finally arrived .
prices are very good .
the dim sum was so ##- ##so , but not spectacular .
the food was so ##- ##so .
the place is larger than most and features adequate seating unlike most joints , and has a bar which deserves a mention .
threw my fiance ' ##s surprise 30th birthday dinner here could n ##' ##t be happier .
food - awesome .
may , the owner always has a smile on her and will warmly greet you .
for some reason , all the seafood on the menu was unavailable except for the salmon .
the beverages were excellent , and the dessert was good .
next time , we would n ##' ##t dare ordering anything else other than some simple asian app ##eti ##zers and drinks .
please if your thinking about it go , and stay the wait you wo n ##' ##t be disappointed .
if you ' ##d like to have a nice light meal with an asian accent , long tan is a good place on the slope .
when going out for a nice dinner , i like a nice am ##bian ##ce as well as very good food .
highly recommend this as great value for excellent su ##shi and service .
this place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service .
a ##+ ##+ the service was good to excellent along with the attitude .
the food is awesome - definitely try the striped bass .
black white shakes came out good also .
it ' ##s simply the best meal in nyc .
we go on mondays for the prix fix ##e and our experience with the food has been comparable to blue ribbon .
however , they ' ##ve got the most amazing past ##ram ##i and the soup ##s hit the spot .
great bag ##els made the old ##- ##fa ##shi ##oned way .
this is some really good , inexpensive su ##shi .
my personal favorite is an everything bag ##el with lo ##x spread , but all the bag ##les are un ##bel ##ia ##va ##bly good .
i would n ##' ##t even have complained at all if the food at least tasted good but the quality of food was crap ##py , too .
for the next hour and a half we stood in the crowded lobby area of this tourist ##y restaurant listening to all types of explanations of why we were not being seated .
the pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nice ##st in nyc .
also good for client lunch meetings , es ##p .
the decor is dark , cool and soothing , while the food ' ##s presentation is spectacular , considering the low prices .
the waits ##taff were very nice and suggested sword ##fish for my husband he enjoyed his meal .
the setting is casual and romantic .
terrible , terrible management - deserves to be shut ##- ##down .
great friendly service , fast seating , fast delivery , excellent su ##shi .
the italian food has flavor ( that can be sort of surprising on the u ##es ) , and the service turns from a nightmare to at ##ten ##tive , they sort of remind me of the ny yankees of the late 90 ' ##s , no matter how bad it look , you knew that there was a rally just around the corner ...
mi ##zu is home to creative and unique rolls not to found anywhere else .
bal ##uchi ' ##s has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices .
mo ##ules were excellent , lobster ravi ##oli was very salty !
a cheap eat for nyc , but not for dos ##a .
the seafood is amazing , there ' ##s a good wine list , and the ever ##- ##chang ##ing menu always offers some great surprises .
the food was just ok , at least for what food was available .
the waitress was very patient with us and the food is phenomena ##l !
the am ##bie ##nce was nice , but service was n ##' ##t so great .
solid wine list , knowledge ##able staff , friendly owners and an adventurous , ever ##- ##chang ##ing menu keep us coming back .
the people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in new york sometimes .
the location and am ##bie ##nce is ok but the food is what makes up for it .
i love and i know go ##ur ##met food by excellence !
i plan to come here again and look forward to trying their assortment of br ##us ##chet ##ta , pan ##ini ' ##s ... . ##.
two people in our party felt like something else , and vol ##are immediately obliged with two great dishes that were not in their regular menu .
he offers sub ##par service and has no personality .
the waitress remembers me and is very friendly , she knows what my regular is and that ' ##s the fried mini bun ##s with the condensed milk and the ass ##orted fruits on bean ##cu ##rd .
diner food at bis ##tro prices is a bum ##mer ... .
while we thoroughly enjoyed the food , it was annoying to scream across the table for conversation .
the portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter .
delicious bag ##els , especially when right out of the oven .
this is one great place to eat pizza more out but not a good place for take ##- ##out pizza .
try green curry with vegetables .
first of all , this place is * ##not ##* romantic , as claimed by city ##sea ##rch ' ##s editorial review .
the second you walk through the heavy vault like door , with people anticipating your arrival you get the sense that you are going to have the dining ride of a lifetime .
much more reasonably priced too !
the food was not very ta ##sty , the port ##io ##ins were tiny even for such a high quality restaurant .
the pad thai is excellent here , as well .
i do not recommend lunch specials just because it ta ##sts the same with other regular chinese restaurant .
we parked on the block of nina ' ##s the place looked nice , with people obviously enjoying their pizza ##s .
the food is o ##. ##k ##. , but not any better than what you get at a good neighborhood restaurant .
we had the pot ##- ##stick ##ers which were great and a te ##mp ##ura dish that was great .
i think the stuff was better than disney .
while the $ 20 en ##tree range is not overly expensive , in new york city , there is definitely better food in that range , and so sapphire , despite it ' ##s lovely atmosphere , will most likely not be a restaurant to which i will return .
or ##say , is without a doubt one of the best values for authentic french food in nyc .
well , their deliveries take for ever and the food is usually cold .
and really large portions .
this is a great thai restaurant with a very friendly staff .
i ordered the smoked salmon and roe app ##eti ##zer and it was off flavor .
we went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a saturday , and i was thoroughly impressed with the food .
i recommend the garlic shrimp , ok ##ra ( bind ##i ) , and anything with lamb .
the food is great and authentic .
good for casual dinner with jeans and sneakers .
anyway , the food is good , the price is right and they have a decent wine list .
this place has many different styles of pizza and they are all amazing .
the food was great .
pair you food with the excellent beers on tap or their well priced wine list .
if you like your music blasted and the system isn ##t that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle mini ##mun then you ' ##ll love it here .
met ##raz ##ur has a beautiful spot overlooking the main terminal .
the restaurant is rather small but we were lucky to get a table quickly .
quality of food is excellent and price is cheap , stick to pork , fish , chicken , lamb and vegetables .
the place is a little tight and on a cold day , the seating by the entrance ##way can be pretty draft ##y .
but , they were too big for the bun .
the food is fresh , delicious , and reasonably priced .
rag ##a stands out with an interesting fusion of french and indian cooking .
the bag ##els are fabulous .
oh yes , and they lie on the phone , claiming they have seating in the garden , then of course the seats are not available .
although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat .
the food was very good , a great deal , and the place its self was great .
probably much bus ##ier for lunch , it ' ##s seldom crowded for dinner ( too close to downtown ) .
their cal ##zone ##s are horrific , bad , vomit ##- ##ind ##uc ##ing , yu ##ck .
it takes forever to get a drink and they almost always forget to bring something ( although they don ##t forget to charge you for it .
the place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening .
saturday , nov ##. 6th i had a group from work come in with about 35 people and the staff was amazing to acc ##omo ##date us .
good spreads , great beverage selections and bag ##els really ta ##sty .
also , top the meal with a delicious and perfect slice of ti ##ram ##is ##u .
check out the secret back room .
it ' ##s also attached to angel ' ##s share , which is a cool , more romantic bar ...
i am amazed by the poor reviews ##- i find this place to be stand ##out italian in an area flooded with italian ##- great prices , great atmosphere , good service and a wonderful wine list .
with the theater 2 blocks away we had a delicious meal in a beautiful room .
the food is great and reasonably priced .
over the years the host , vittorio , and his crew , have always treated me as family - ##- although with all the business this not ##- ##so ##- ##lit ##tle gem does , it amazing he ' ##s even able to remember a consistent but not ##- ##so ##- ##fr ##e ##quent visitor .
the rest ##ua ##rant itself is not large , but seems to have several round tables to acc ##omo ##date large groups hoping to save a buck to eat authentic taiwanese .
my husband said he could ' ##ve eaten several more , the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had .
it is the type of place to run into old friends and have a late , ra ##uc ##ous dinner .
the food is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu ##- ##fare , the dishes are never a disappointment .
the combination of fresh tomato sauce , fresh mo ##zz cheese , basil and the dough they make with imported flour , makes this is one of the better pizza ' ##s in ny .
for all of you new to indian food , try the pan ##eer roll , it is a piece of heaven .
the food looked very app ##eti ##zing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates .
both the fresh mo ##zz ##ere ##lla slices and the plain cheese slice are phenomena ##l .
the food is terrible and overall , i would have to say avoid at all costs .
it ' ##s constantly open , catering to the pakistani cab ##bies lined up on crosby st ##. , so there ' ##s more turnover with the food than you ' ##d expect ( i ##. ##e ##. , surprisingly fresh ) .
i went at 6 ##: ##00 pm specifically for the pre ##- ##the ##ater menu ( $ 19 ##. ##9 ##5 for roasted tomato soup with che ##vre , steak fr ##ites , cr ##eme br ##ule ##e ) and it was marvelous .
the waits ##taff were at ##ten ##tive , polite and helpful - an impressive feat in such close quarters .
- the bread at the beginning is super ta ##sty and makes you want more - the pizza is delicious and comes in personal sizes , however be warned that the peter ' ##s favourite pizza with pro ##sc ##iu ##tto and baby ar ##ug ##ula is actually a mar ##gar ##ite pizza with cold pro ##sc ##iu ##tto and baby ar ##ug ##ula on top , like a salad .
have always found that the waiter ##s will go out of their way to be helpful , despite the fact they are often busy with lots of diner ##s .
the owner truly cater ##s to all your needs .
he takes real pride in his food and his business .
so if you want a nice , enjoyable meal at mont ##par ##nas ##se , go early for the pre ##- ##the ##ater prix ##- ##fi ##x ##e .
over the years , it has always provided a pleas ##urable dining experience with quality food and wine .
the photo ##book menu was a cute touch , certainly helped my group and i pick the fried chicken , pork chop , and no ##odle dishes that we all ordered .
i can not imagine better indian food in all of the city .
very good bread ##s as well .
pizza is terrific , as is homemade pasta .
this is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value of ##r money .
from beginning app ##eti ##zers , the sc ##all ##ops were incredible , to the delicious chocolate so ##uf ##fle with ras ##berry mint so ##rb ##et , we were delighted by the taste sensations .
my goodness , everything from the fish to the rice to the sea ##weed was absolutely amazing .
the food is reliable and the price is moderate .
while the am ##bian ##ce and atmosphere were great , the food and service could have been a lot better .
the server was really cool and served us our food and drinks with a smile .
planet thailand has always been a hit with me , i go there usually for the su ##shi , which is great , the thai food is excellent too .
the sauce on the pizza is soo ##o good with garlic and fresh tomatoes and they do n ##' ##t ski ##mp .
we recently decided to try this location , and to our delight , they have outdoor seating , perfect since i had my york ##ie with me .
my husband had the me ##sc ##lun , salmon , and ice cream and he enjoyed all 3 courses .
the food is usually good but it certainly is n ##' ##t a relaxing place to go .
super friendly and know ##led ##ga ##ble staff , fabulous bis ##tro fare and a wonderful jazz br ##un ##ch with great live jazz ( the chi ##la ##quil ##es were awesome !
the prices were fantastic .
the table service could have been a little more at ##ten ##tive but as someone who also works in the service industry , i understood they were busy .
it ' ##s not mind ##- ##bl ##owing , but to me , thai food never is and never will be .
food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt ##- ##in ##- ##you ##r ##- ##mouth experience ) .
i love the fact that the pizza tastes so good and is so cheap .
service was prompt , friendly and great .
i have n ##' ##t eat a lamb chop as delicious as that , the salad ##s are really nice dressed with lemon and extra vi ##rg ##nin olive oil .
the su ##shi was awful !
you can get an excellent meal at most of the many indian restaurants on nearby lexington avenue for the cost of one the dai ##nty dishes here .
the plain pizza was so ##ggy and the creative wild mushroom ( third generation ##- ##for ##nin ##i ) pizza we had was drenched with tr ##uf ##fle oil in the middle ( again making it so ##ggy ) and nothing ##on the rest .
late ni ##te om ##elle ##tes are not good here , there is no variety !
after all that , they complained to me about the small tip .
it ' ##s a great place to pick up a cheap lunch or dinner .
whenever you need a su ##shi fix , mi ##zu will be there with quality fish and great service .
our waitress was sweet and acc ##omo ##dating , not over ##be ##aring .
i was really disappointed ant wanted to tell everyone not to go eat or even take out food from there .
despite a slightly limited menu , everything prepared is done to perfection , ultra fresh and a work of food art .
the outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful .
brick oven gallery is my pick for best pizza restaurant anywhere .
add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening .
for many people , this may not seem like aunt ##hen ##tic thai food because most places in nyc aren ##t quite authentic .
oh , do n ##' ##t even let me start with how expensive the bills were !
all the app ##eti ##zers and salad ##s were fabulous , the steak was mouth watering and the pasta was delicious ! ! !
besides having the table we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated , we were served dishes we had n ##' ##t ordered three times , received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served ( and that order was under ##co ##oked ) , and charged $ 45 more than we should have been on our bill .
service is top notch .
the food now is inconsistent .
be careful before you request extra spice .
the octopus eater ##s were floor ##ed by the octopus salad .
we thought that this place is using too much of ms ##g cooking in the foods .
and the tom k ##ha soup was pathetic .
i started out with a bombay beer which was big enough for two .
the decor is vibrant and eye ##- ##ple ##asi ##ng with several semi ##- ##pr ##ivate both ##s on the right side of the dining hall , which are great for a date .
the sweet lass ##i was excellent as was the lamb chet ##tina ##d and the garlic na ##an but the ras ##ama ##lai was forget ##table .
we ' ##ve been following chef lyle ' ##s food around new york for 15 years and while remaining classic , his innovations with bis ##tro fare have made us return and return .
the best thing i tasted were the lamb ##cho ##ps .
in addition , the food is very good and the prices are reasonable .
upon entering , we were greeted by the owners , steven and frederick , who went out of their way to be more than gr ##acious hosts .
been going here since it opened have seen the quality value decrease considerably .
they bring service up a notch by offer ##ng complementary am ##use bo ##uche to all tables and gave us a small dessert for our celebration .
try the crunch ##y tuna , it is to die for .
all in all , this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite su ##shi restaurants in the city .
it is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of disney type special effects .
if you ' ##re looking for perfect traditional su ##shi , go here - if you ' ##re looking for interesting combinations , try su ##shi of ga ##ri ' ##s ( east side ) .
be careful of portions - they ' ##re huge .
the steak tar ##tar ##e is a great bet , they fix it for you at the table .
great for large groups and celebrations - our super happy waiter was the entertainment of the evening .
plus , on wednesday nights the house wine is unlimited !
however , in the summer of 2003 , it seems the management has changed and the great big door has been replaced for a glass front rid ##ding itself of the dark romantic get ##up .
we wo n ##' ##t go to this place again for a good meal .
barbecue ##d cod ##fish was gorgeous ##ly moist - as if po ##ache ##d - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland season ##ing - a spice rub might have overwhelmed , however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance .
after dinner , take your date to the huge dance floor , probably one of the biggest you ' ##ll see in ny .
ta ##j mahal offer ##es gr ##et value and great food .
my boyfriend and i recently had an early dinner at art ##isan ##al and was satisfied with our experience .
outstanding bag ##els , but you get what you pay for .
pizza - the only pizza in nyc that should not have additional topping ##s - the crust tastes like the best , freshly baked bread !
i found it on a cold night , the perfect spot to warm up .
service was warm and at ##ten ##tive , beef carp ##aa ##chio was ex ##elle ##nt ( huge portion ) and pasta was fresh and well ##- ##pre ##par ##ed .
best italian food i ever had ( and being italian , that means al ##ot ) .
i will recommend sc ##opa to all of my friends for a place to go for wonderful italian food .
great bar , most gorgeous bartender ##s you ' ##ve ever seen ( specifically the blond lady ) .
i really loved the different and in ##ova ##ted touch that ' ##s the chef ##f gives to the food .
they came out over cooked and the cheese was almost non exist ##ant .
i had a terrific meal , and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our price range , instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that was n ##' ##t as good .
the sv ##c can be a bit rude at times , es ##p if you have big group , but overall the restaurant is a must !
the food is good , especially their more basic dishes , and the drinks are delicious .
but the main hit was the whole grille ##d fish .
on a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch .
the food is delicious and beautifully prepared along with the friendly and persona ##ble service .
pizza here is consistently good .
would n ##' ##t rec ##ome ##nd it for dinner !
sauce was watery and the food did n ##' ##t have much flavor .
my husband and i enjoy sang ##ria .
we both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh .
first the wrong bread came out with the app ##eti ##zer , then when i tried to order a second glass of wine for my main course ...
in an area sadly lacking in decent thai food , this is one of the best spots .
make reservations but expect to be delayed 15 ##- ##20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to time square .
the food was average or above including some surprising ta ##sty dishes .
they do n ##' ##t seem to place an emphasis on specials or fresh ingredients which to me is necessary for good thai .
the crust is thin , the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly .
also a little more expensive than your average bag ##el place .
the food was under ##co ##oked - ##the sauce watery , and the vegetables raw .
and the fried cl ##ams had just enough kick to them to make ' ##em worth eating .
the sauce ##s used are also not that exciting .
the secret is the lunch menu which offers a compliment ##ary app ##eti ##zer with every en ##tree ordered .
the shrimp sc ##amp ##i was excellent and the anti ##pas ##ti were pl ##ent ##iful .
i got the $ 10 10 ##- ##piece dim sum combo , every bite of which was great .
there is also very limited seating and there can be a substantial wait in getting food at peak times .
if it ' ##s just a quick martini at the bar ( which i recommend jeff ##ery ' ##s ) or a mind blowing roast chicken , go to village !
there was a long wait for a table outside , but it was a little too hot in the sun anyway so our ins ##de table was very nice .
the prices are wonderful ##ly low .
i have never been disappointed but their true strength lays in their amazingly delicious and cheap lunch specials .
so much more than the usual bar food , go there to enjoy the menu while sampling one of their hand ##- ##craft ##ed beers .
no free drink .
this is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent .
do n ##' ##t waste money on decor .
they also have a back garden open in the summer - cute and french with outdoor seating - what more could you ask for ?
i have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good ni ##giri .
given the incredible architecture surrounding it , this place has no character .
while the place is not a hot ##sp ##ot hang ##out , the drinks are unique and pack a lot of bang for the buck .
their egg ##pl ##ant is so delicate , sweet tender !
each bite of food at kai was indeed delicious , fresh , and elegant .
all the food was excellent - considering the quality of food in most moderately priced restaurants is med ##io ##cre this was slightly more price ##y and well worth it .
i had the cod with pa ##ella ( spicy and very filling , i ' ##m a big eater and could only eat half ) while my boyfriend had the classic fish and chips ( again , a big serving - at least 5 pieces of fish and a basket ##ful of fries ) .
it ' ##s a shame that a nice , convenient place like the pink pony can be so ruined by lou ##sy service .
try the spicy won ##ton ##s and the salt pepper shrimp ##s .
the fries are yu ##mmy .
friendly and inform ##ative staff , very at ##ten ##tive and prompt raw bar service .
best taiwanese food in ny !
this place is a great stop for great food .
all the pasta ##s are fantastic and the homemade las ##ag ##na is some of the best that i have had in the city .
and the prices were way to high for what you get .
the staff ignored my friends and i the entire time we were there .
yet paired with such rude service , would never recommend for anyone interested in carrying any kind of conversation while there .
the in ##- ##house lady dj on saturday nights has outrageous ##ly good taste in music , and moreover , takes requests .
great wine list , reasonably priced . - ##- sara
the hot dogs were cold in the middle and the bun ##s were stale .
while the food was excellent , it was n ##' ##t cheap ( though not extremely expensive either ) .
beef no ##odle soup is good as well .
delivery service is great too .
the food ' ##s dazzling flavors over ##w ##helm the pal ##ate , truly embracing the beauty of authentic thai cuisine .
i rec ##ie ##ved prompt service with a smile .
they pray to their food gods to make them into a good pizza like vt ' ##s .
the place was quiet and delightful .
the food is a diamond in rough - ##- the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes .
as much as i like the food there , i ca n ##' ##t bring myself to go back .
the prices and am ##bie ##nce are especially great considering it ' ##s in the west village .
the soup is pretty good too .
it is so easy to get a reservation at a top place in nyc with a week ' ##s notice .
not the food , not the am ##bian ##ce , not the service , i agree with the previous reviews you wait and wait , the wait staff are very rude and when you get in they are looking to get you right out .
i always get the sha ##bu ##- ##sha ##bu dinner and the beef is always fresh .
the pizza was delivered cold and the cheese was n ##' ##t even fully melted !
we were very surprised by how good the food was on our first visit here on a sunday night .
nh ##a tran ##g , while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor , horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals , is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i ' ##ve ever been to . the ph ##o is delicious and comes with very fresh ve ##gt ##able ##s .
on the other hand , if you are not fooled easily , you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and am ##bian ##ce that is on par with alain duc ##asse , and food that will outs ##hine in present ##ai ##on , taste , choice , quality and quantity .
if i could rate the people this place would be off the charts - unfortunately - the pizza , sorry - not the best in nyc .
having not been home in the last 2 years may sk ##ew this reviewer a bit , but the food was ta ##sty and spicy sans the oil that comes floating along at similar venues .
the portions are now very small , the sauce ##s are overly ambitious usually in ##ed ##ible while the service is still good , the restaurant , due to its popularity , seems frantic .
the owner is very friendly and a great guy , go try his pizza , you ' ##ll like it !
the atmosphere is great ! ! !
with so many good restaurants on the u ##ws , i do n ##' ##t need over ##pr ##ice ##d food , absurd ##ly arrogant wait ##- ##sta ##ff who do n ##' ##t recognize they work at a g ##lor ##ified diner , clumsy service , and management that does n ##' ##t care .
i tend to judge a su ##shi restaurant by its sea ur ##chin , which was heavenly at su ##shi rose .
the service is a little sc ##att ##y at times but all is forgiven when the food arrives .
the br ##us ##ce ##tta is a bit so ##ggy , but the salad ##s were fresh , included a nice mix of greens ( not ice ##berg ) all dishes are served pip ##ing hot from the kitchen .
the atmosphere is n ##' ##t the greatest , but i suppose that ' ##s how they keep the prices down .
the pick ##les were great addition .
if your favorite chinese food is general tao chicken , then this is not your place .
you must try the shrimp app ##eti ##zers .
not only is the cuisine the best around , the service has always been at ##ten ##tive and charming .
the production is a symphony , al ##ot of fun to experience ##. ##the food sublime for the most part .
waiter ##s tend to forget drinks completely , food portions are so tiny , two people have trouble sharing one en ##tree .
but the thing that my wife and i hated was it was so loud and it felt like ' bar ' or ' pub ' .
while there are plenty of places to go for a good corn ##ed beef sandwich , katz ' ##s has a charm about it .
however , looking at the table next to ours , we both sort of wished we had ordered pizza , which looked perfect
priced at upper intermediate range .
if you live in new york city , you ' ##ll find better food at small restaurants outside of time square and spend half the amount .
they did n ##' ##t di ##sa ##pp ##oint , service from the second i arrived at the door was extremely pleasant and at ##ten ##tive with almost one server per table .
i do n ##' ##t know who they think they are but they have no respect for the residents of the neighborhood ever since they opened their cabaret next door and blasts loud music till three in the morning every weekend during the summer .
the only positive was the wait staff , which was prompt , know ##led ##ga ##ble , and like ##able .
i am not a vegetarian but , almost all the dishes were great .
i was very impressed by this low ##- ##key upper east ##side ##r and their authentic ##ally thai cuisine ! ! !
for the location , the prices are very reasonable .
the food is okay and the prices here are med ##io ##cre .
my friend ' ##s food was also the complete opposite of what it ' ##s supposed to taste like ( and look like ) .
we have been to this place many times , and always have great food , wine , and service .
not a typical pizza joint , but good for a low key and fairly cheap nice sit down dinner .
the corn ##ed beef was tender and melted in my mouth .
the best chicken pad tai , i ' ##ve ever had .
$ 20 for all you can eat su ##shi can not be beaten .
ha ##ru serves very fresh fish , has a trend ##y , modern am ##bian ##ce , prime location on park avenue south and friendly service .
warm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months .
very romantic fires - i ' ##ve literally spent hours at lantern ##a , drinking wine from their extensive wine and enjoying the am ##bie ##nce .
we got a little tips ##y from the sake but is n ##' ##t that what saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about ?
my turkey burger was not cooked at all , my friends salmon was completely raw .
his drinks are very in ##vent ##ive , delicious and class ##y .
great food , great prices , great service .
awesome pizza especially the mar ##gh ##eri ##tta slice .
this place , however , has a lot less pre ##tension than joy ##a and the thai food is still above average .
try ordering from the regular menu , then you would not regret !
we started with lo ##x and mu ##ssel ##s ( the best iv ##e ever had , ever ) and had the cod and trout for dinner .
food is great .
i recommend the meat ##balls and cap ##res ##e salad and the beans on toast were a wonderful start to the meal !
this place is incredibly tiny .
i did n ##' ##t complain , i liked the atmosphere so much .
the wine is always good , the tap ##as are always yu ##mmy , especially with the warm pit ##a bread .
but when you are seated the waitress ##es are great , they explain everything on the menu , and the price of the food is really cheap for the service you get .
i ' ##ve been to several places for dim sum and this has got to be the worst .
the fresh ##est , best variety , and the fastest delivery .
go to vol ##are for 1st class service and terrific food .
the sandwiches are dry , taste ##less and way over ##pr ##ice ##d .
the fried rice is really good too .
we were well attended to by the enthusiastic staff especially the manager tony gas ##kin who made excellent suggestions for our menu selections .
made my dining experience uncomfortable .
a very inviting restaurant , with friendly service .
we also had shared a house salad that was fresh .
the ceiling is amazing !
not a small feat for good french food in the area .
the space is a bit too small for live music , so on jazz nights , it can be loud and cramped .
big wong gets big ups for a fine establishment .
the en ##tree was bland and small , dessert was not inspired .
the staff was the friend ##liest that have seen in new york .
with the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering , the food here was decent , not great .
the pad thai , lad na ##r and various other dishes all look good on paper but , i ' ##ve had better thai food in less as ##the ##tically pleasing places .
delicious food at a great price but do not go here on a cold day and sit by the front door .
overall , i ' ##m still impressed that the place even exists and the prices are quite decent but then again , its chinatown .
pizza was a little so ##ggy .
the food in ##lu ##des famous sc ##rum ##pt ##ious bombay style cha ##at such as b ##hel ##puri , se ##v ##puri and sam ##osa cha ##ats , as well as other great indian app ##eti ##zers .
the only problem is that the manager is a complete inc ##omp ##ete ##nt .
the wine list is interesting and has many good values .
definite go if you ' ##re used to good indian restaurant food from abroad .
by far , the best pizza in manhattan .
decent thai food in cute - though a bit dan ##k - little no ##lita hang ##out , but service terrible .
the food is mostly made from scratch , fresh and well prepared .
no more reservations , expensive tips and annoying stuff .
$ 20 gets you unlimited su ##shi of a very high quality - ##- i even took a friend here from japan who said it was one of the best su ##shi places in the us that he has been to .
su ##shi was n ##' ##t anything spectacular for the price .
but they do n ##' ##t have a toast ##er , which is strange .
so , for good food i ' ##d recommend it , but not for a fun night out .
the menu choices are similar but the taste lacked more flavor than it looked .
a must for all the dos ##a lovers .
the portions are huge , so it might be good to order three things to split ( rather than one app ##eti ##zer and en ##tree per person ) for two people .
the app ##eti ##zers are just ok and the main courses were decidedly sub ##par .
the exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations .
the staff is very at ##ten ##tive and we can almost always get a table .
try the mediterranean salad , it is a true experience for your taste buds ! !
people are always friendly .
the cream cheese ##s are out of this world and i love that coffee ! !
from the en ##tree ##s to the sides to the drinks , everything was creative ##ly prepared yet still simple .
service was prompt and court ##eous .
it was not above ordinary and the beef version had cheap ( under ##co ##oked ) beef .
chance is a small cozy restaurant , with a romantic feel to it , the decor is great .
only wine and beer are served , but the house var ##ities are actually quite good .
we split a ta ##sty vegetable sam ##osa and the mala ##i ti ##kka wrap .
knowledge of the chef and the waitress are below average .
decent wine selection too .
i have to say i have never had a di ##sa ##point ##ing meal here .
if you want a casual neighborhood bis ##tro that has great food and excellent service , this is the place .
great place to go for a drink too because they have 100 kinds of beer .
meanwhile , the bartender continued to pour champagne from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an am ##use of turn ##ip soup with pure ##ed basil , gr ##ati ##s .
the food was well prepared and the service imp ##eca ##ble .
but their best dish is th ##h thai spice ##d curry noodles with shrimp - a dish that would cost $ 23 ##. ##9 ##5 is most places , but it is $ 16 here .
good , dark atmosphere and the music is a nice touch .
but the thai is definitely not great - ##- bland and und ##ist ##ing ##uis ##hed .
great for groups , great for a date , great for early br ##un ##ch or a night ##cap .
our friendly server made great food suggestions and also sent both the somme ##lier and the from ##ager to the table to help suggest different pairing ##s for wine and cheese .
while the food was good ( certainly no il mu ##lino ) the service was ho ##rre ##ndo ##us .
service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category .
i would recommend reservations on weekends though .
great pizza for lunch place .
we were a group of 8 and well se ##ved .
i love their spicy sc ##all ##op roll , and my boyfriend consistently gets the sesame chicken .
best dish is nor ##i ##- ##wr ##app ##ed tuna .
the food was absolutely amazing ! !
an excellent alternative to fast food joints and ordering in but , the food was slightly disappointing .
mermaid inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood .
the staff is also at ##ten ##tive and friendly .
that is a problem since we paid about 20 bucks a dish , and had to order 5 dishes to get a decent taste .
they were such a rip ##- ##off ( $ 8 ##. ##9 ##5 for four small meat patti ##es in steamed bun ##s ) and not worth trying .
all of the pizza ##s are terrific and the price is even better !
it is about food and am ##bian ##ce , and imagine how dreadful it will be it we only had to listen to an idle engine .
the food was good too .
admitted ##ly , this is not the place for gigantic pieces of fish over ##flow ##ing the plate ( and thank goodness , in my opinion ) but for simple , elegant su ##shi there is no better place in new york or anywhere in the us .
the menu seemed to have a wide variety of dishes for seafood lovers and interesting ways of preparing them .
the white bean brush ##etta to start was incredible and the pasta was phenomena ##l .
the rest of the menu is limited by everything is good eats .
great food , great lay out and awesome service .
we walked in on a wednesday night and were seated promptly .
the wait staff is very fr ##ein ##dly , they make it feel like you ' ##re eating in a fr ##ein ##dly little european town .
the waits ##taff are all very busy , it ' ##s not outstanding service , but i ' ##ve never been dealt with rude ##ly .
the flavors are great , and the menu is extensive .
the food has been consist ##ant for years and it never lets you down .
and forget what you read under me , the atmosphere is n ##' ##t that bad either .
we could n ##' ##t carry our conversation as we were routinely interrupted by waitress and servants asking us to order and hint ##ing that we ' ##re taking too much time - ##- amazing , we just sat down .
sometimes i get good food and ok service .
it ' ##s a place for people who pay a lot for med ##io ##cre food , noise and a chance to be with their fellow bridge and tunnel folks .
after complaining about the chicken dish , the manager came over to tell us that , no one had ever complained before , and that we just did n ##' ##t know what the dish was supposed to taste like .
the food was spicy and delicious .
bartender was unable to tear himself away from friends at bar .
anyway ##s , if you ' ##re in the neighborhood to eat good food , i would n ##' ##t waste my time trying to find something , rather go across the street to tam ##ari .
this was my fr ##ist time at cafe st ##. bart ' ##s and i must say how del ##ico ##us the food and the service was .
one would think we ' ##d get an apology or compliment ##ary drinks - instead , we got a s ##nob ##by waiter would n ##' ##t even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so .
we actually gave 10 % tip ( which we have never done despite med ##io ##cre food and service ) , because we felt totally ripped off .
we were looking forward to nice glass of sang ##ria when we arrived .
i would highly recommend requesting a table by the window .
while we enjoyed the food , we were highly disappointed by the poor service ( waiter was not quite competent and slow service ) and lack of remorse .
we ' ##ve been to grocery three times and not once has an item on the menu disappointed .
a touch more ja ##la ##pen ##o heat for contrast and it would have been very good indeed .
we ate out in the back patio , which is worth it as it ' ##s cool and the music is hear well there .
gu ##aca ##mo ##le ##+ ##sh ##rim ##p app ##eti ##zer was really great , we both had the file ##t , very good , did n ##' ##t much like the fr ##ites that came with , but the file ##t was so good , neither of us cared .
nothing fancy but really good food with pretty reasonable price .
while i quite liked the food and the am ##bie ##nce , i ' ##m not quite sure if it they really deserve it the michel ##in rating they have displayed so pro ##oud ##ly in the window .
not worth the prices .
from the moment you enter till the moment you walk out the friendly and helpful staff was was just fantastic .
service was good and food is wonderful .
the quality of food at this restaurant accompanied by fantastic live jazz makes this place a perfect 10 !
if your visiting , you ' ##ll enjoy the am ##bian ##ce and the fact that it ' ##s in time sq ...
service and food is what any one would expect when spending that type of money .
love the atmosphere - felt like i was in paris .
every course was better than the next .
the staff is incredibly helpful and at ##ten ##tive .
the yellow ##tail was particularly good as well .
i ate cl ##ams ore ##gan ##ta and spectacular salad with perfectly marina ##ted cu ##cum ##bers and tomatoes with lots of shrimp and basil .
the menu changed , portions were even smaller than before , a lent ##il dish was salty beyond ed ##ibility , a bas ##mat ##i rice dish lacked flavor .
pat ##ro ##on features a nice cigar bar and has great staff .
very affordable and excellent ambient !
more important , the su ##shi rivals the best in tokyo .
why do people rave about the am ##bie ##nce .
flu ##ke sash ##imi dr ##iz ##zle ##d with ja ##la ##pen ##o ##- ##lim ##e olive oil , the fruit of the oil nicely highlighting the fish ' ##s sweetness .
great su ##shi experience .
if you ' ##re looking for a great meal at a decent price , go to del fr ##is ##co ' ##s !
try the cong ##ee and the don ##ut like deep fried dough they call ow ley so ##h , a delicious and sweet tasting bread .
the food was delicious and the waiter was incredibly helpful and at ##ten ##tive ( considering we were the only ones there for the first hour ) .
the place was real empty but that was because this was the first sunday they ever opened .
this little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money .
am ##bie ##nce is delightful , service imp ##ec ##cable .
you get the sense that the people there care about their restaurant and about your experience and that is very nice .
both are delicious , the cooks are friendly and are willing to take a moment and speak to you and shake your hand .
the staff was acc ##omo ##dating , the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely .
my picks are : - sc ##all ##ion pan ##cake ( fried with vegetable juice , very special and ta ##sty ) - gui ##zhou chicken - shredded squid family style ( one of my personal favorites ) - sichuan spicy soft shell crab - shu ##iz ##hu fish ( this one is for hardcore sichuan food fans , i would n ##' ##t recommend to my american friends as it ' ##s very spicy .
they smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spin ##ach mushroom cal ##zone .
there was a great deal for 6 blue point oyster ##s and a beer or glass of wine for $ 8 !
i really liked the no ##odle dishes at rice avenue compared to their green curry dish .
but for whatever reason , prices are about twice as high .
i am relatively new to the area and tried pick a b ##gel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and i thought the food was over ##ated and on the price ##y side .
great atm ##osh ##ere and worth every bit .
the staff was knowledge ##able and full of personality .
only complaint would be that at an average cost of $ 12 ##- $ 15 per meal , i ' ##d like not to have to worry about finding a seat !
the banana tower is an amazing dessert as well .
excellent atmosphere , delicious dishes good and friendly service .
a cool place to hang with your friends for a couple of healthy drinks and dessert ##s .
i like ma ##mo ##un ' ##s food as well , but side by side , kat ##i rolls just produce ta ##sti ##er food hands down .
the service is a bit slow , but ha ##rke ##ns back to my years growing up in napoli , italy where things are not rushed and when you sit down for dinner the table is yours all night .
a cool bar with great food , and tons of excellent beer .
be sure to try the seasonal , and always delicious , specials .
the am ##bie ##nce is authentic and relaxing and we have always received at ##ten ##tive and prompt service .
fresh , authentic , french cuisine in substantial portions .
drinks got screwed up , she acted put upon .
the one vegetarian en ##tree ( abby ' ##s treasure ) was actually quite a surprise - it was delicious and had winter ##mel ##on covering an assortment of fresh mushrooms and vegetables .
but the pizza is way to expensive .
and the staff is also young , en ##er ##ge ##ic and hot ! ! ! !
even better , they know how to cook french classics like steak au po ##iv ##re and on ##gle ##t without burning it to death or over ##co ##oki ##ng it .
we had a wonderful meal at naples 45 a month ago on a visit to nyc .
good drink .
even though i made the reservation at 3 ##pm for the same night through dinner ##bro ##ker , we were seated at a table with one of the best view !
i did n ##' ##t take a look at the rest menu , but the oyster ##s were fantastic .
the grille ##d cheese at home afterwards was better . ! !
great service , great food .
sometimes i get bad food and bad service , sometimes i get good good and bad service .
in summer ##- ##ea ##t outside on a terrace ( another great feature of su ##an ) ! ! !
it ' ##s the perfect restaurant for ny life style , it got cool design , awesome drinks and food and lot ' ##s of good looking people eating and hanging at the pink bar ...
good , fast service .
i was in love with po ##ng ##sr ##i on 48th , but compared to su ##an it is slow in service and over ##pr ##ice ##d .
my friends and i experienced amazing cheese and a delicious , new summer menu at art ##isan ##al last night .
it ' ##s charming ##ly small and that leads to an atm ##osh ##ere that is extremely cozy and romantic , even .
love the jazz bands on fr ##i and sat .
the service was ok .
do n ##' ##t expect to sit down inside though , there are only a few tables and they are always full .
the staff is acc ##omo ##dating , the am ##bian ##ce is exciting and yet relaxed , and the food is out of this world !
the food was delicious ( i had a hal ##ib ##ut special , my husband had steak ) , and the service was top ##- ##not ##ch .
the manager claimed that he could not compensate us for anything on the bill which just shows the lack of so ##phi ##stic ##ation from the entire group .
it ' ##s the only place you can get yu ##mmy authentic japanese comfort food .
we took ad ##vana ##tage of the half price su ##shi deal on saturday so it was well worth it .
the staff are at ##ten ##tive , and have smiles on their faces .
largest and fresh ##est pieces of su ##shi , and delicious !
even the pasta is delicious here ( a ra ##rity in new york pizza restaurants ) .
but when we looked at the menu , there were n ##' ##t a lot of choices , most of them were dump ##lings in the app ##eti ##zer section .
wait staff is b ##lan ##ten ##tly una ##pp ##re ##cia ##tive of your business but its the best pie on the u ##ws !
the ingredients taste fresh ##er , the crust is thinner and crisp ##ier , the slice is less oil ##y , and it ' ##s never burnt like it occasionally is at joe ' ##s .
fish is so very fresh .
the prices were cheap compared to the quality of service and food .
top spot in town for vietnamese classics , better than places that cost a lot more .
less wait time for me !
the decor is really blah , and not at all hip or happening .
i come from a family of pi ##zz ##eria owners , and i ' ##m almost ashamed to say that the pizza in for ##nin ##o ' ##s blows my families rec ##ei ##pies away .
the lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with sc ##all ##ops and shrimp is great .
the food was authentic .
the dim sum is del ##ect ##able while the prices are quite easy on the wallet .
i only tried a simple dish of spin ##ach ravi ##oli in a light oil and garlic sauce , but it actually fair ##ed better than most nyc italian joints i ' ##ve tried similar dishes at .
the worst excuse for japanese food i ' ##ve ever encountered .
we had pam ' ##s special fried fish and it was amazing .
my boyfriend had the new england chow ##der it was good but i think the award should go to the lobster bis ##que .
not enough wines by the glass either .
i must say it ' ##s a little price ##y for the food because it was not as spectacular as the view .
we were worried we would have trouble getting in , but somehow managed to have a short wait .
my wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it .
the service is awful - ##- the last time i was there ( and i do mean the last time ) we were told that they needed our table so we would have to leave .
try the green curry ! ! !
we had the sc ##all ##ops as an app ##eti ##zer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful .
we were also seated promptly at the time of our reservation and the service was very quick and professional .
the food there are sas ##tify ##ing .
i highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks !
great wine selection , gig ##onda ##s is worth the price , and the house champagne is a great value .
at night , but it ' ##s hard to hear your own conversation with everyone else competing for that same luxury - the music playing in the background is also vol ##umi ##nous .
i particularly love their yellow ##fu ##n tuna and their mu ##ssel selection .
i love to visit murray ##s for my bag ##el fix .
we made early dinner reservations and were thoroughly impressed , reminds me of my grandfather , its old school italian scenery with lots of fun stuff to admire .
cheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at $ 10 .
most of the servers are very at ##ten ##tive , friendly and quite attractive .
service is average .
but they ' ##ve done a really nice job of offering all the typical pi ##zz ##eria fa ##ves plus some terrific specials like the god ##mot ##her pizza ( a sort of traditional flat pizza with an olive oil ##- ##brush ##ed crust and less tomato sauce than usual ) .
the steak is good , the fish is good and the su ##shi was surprisingly great .
the service was poor , restaurant poorly lit , staff not very at ##ten ##tive and i would have rather eaten at a mcdonald ' ##s than this joint .
my g ##f and i still choose to eat there a lot because of diverse cocktail ##s , the chill decor , and the decent su ##shi .
we ended the dinner with a surprisingly light and fl ##ak ##y apple tar ##te ta ##tin .
the buffet had a nice selection .
waits ##taff are very friendly .
service was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded .
the food was below average , the service was pathetic , there was no am ##bie ##nce at all .
i really enjoyed the shows put on by the actors .
service was efficient court ##eous .
the mis ##o soup lacked flavor and the fish was unfortunately not as well prepared as in the past .
they are the best bag ##els i ' ##ve had .
too ##ns has recently been red ##one , so it ' ##s now a very attractive space .
while the prices are nothing special , the portions are huge .
its a nice quiet location to go eat a good meal , relax , be able to talk and have a very good time .
however , i think this place is a good hang out spot .
the wine list is extensive and impressive .
while the staff at this little bis ##tro is very friendly , i have never experienced more inc ##omp ##ete ##ncy .
the qu ##ail was fantastic and unique and the pasta ##s were full of flavor .
the staff is court ##eous and friendly .
aside from the rushed service , we were very impressed with the food and the drinks .
i would highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a fine indian dining experience that is definitely a value for your dollar .
this big draw is the all you can su ##shi here for $ 19 ##. ##9 ##5 !
some of the workers ignore me and talk to the female customers , other times , they ' ##ve skipped my order .
the specials are usually quite good too .
they ' ##ve the best dessert ##s and mixed drinks as well as snack foods .
really cool st ##au ##ff inside .
while the new restaurant still features much of the same classical furniture that made ti ##ffin so attractive , the menu has been overhaul ##ed .
the best burger i have had in the village .
only draw ##back - they wo n ##' ##t toast your bag ##el , and they do n ##' ##t make eggs for the bag ##el .
as always we had a great glass of wine while we waited .
the wait staff is pleasant , fun , and for the most part gorgeous ( in the wonderful aesthetic beau ##ti ##fication way , not in that she ##' ##s ##- ##way ##- ##cute ##r ##- ##than ##- ##me ##- ##tha ##t ##- ##b @ # $ * way ) .
of course this atmosphere is lacking , but what do you expect from a 24 hour bag ##el place anyway ##s ?
service was very good and warm .
corn ##elia street looks like a broadway set for west side story and the inside of po is so cool qu ##aint you really ca n ##' ##t top the setting for a romantic dinner in nyc .
food was good and the view of the new york city ski ##line was terrific even on a fog ##gy rainy day like that of when i went .
the food is decent at best , and the am ##bie ##nce , well , it ' ##s a matter of opinion , some may consider it to be a sweet thing , i thought it was just annoying .
the service was a bit slow , but they were very friendly .
leon is an east village gem : casual but hip , with well prepared basic french bis ##tro fare , good specials , a warm and lively atmosphere .
the food is above average for midtown and sl ##ig ##tly better than some of the other heartland brewer ##ies in the city .
th ##ius is a must for anyone who loves sha ##bu ##- ##sha ##bu .
the food was absolutely horrible !
similar to other indian restaurants , they use the dinner special to attract customers at the door .
the people with carts of food do n ##' ##t understand you because they do n ##' ##t speak english , their job is to give you the delicious food you point at .
the crack ##ling cal ##ama ##ri salad , which is usually a cheap disaster at many restaurants , is crisp ##y and lightly dressed .
not the greatest su ##shi place , but excellent for a $ 19 ##. ##9 ##5 all you can eat .
shocking ##ly easy to throw a group dinner here : simple contract , deposit only to hold the date the entire 2nd fl me ##zz for our gr ##p of 20 .
the thai ice tea was amazingly smooth and yu ##mmy !
drinks way over priced .
the main downs ##ide to the place is the nazi ##- ##like guy running it who constantly complain ##s about the noise level .
moderate prices .
i think i ' ##ve had some the best meals of my life at min ##now .
most importantly , food is excellent .
great roof ##deck , nice group of 30 something ##s , but no music , kind of quiet .
however , service was as plain as sesame crust ##ed salmon i had .
it ' ##s great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend .
the food was med ##io ##cre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back .
you get what you pay for and with that logic in mind , spice is a great place to grab some cheap eats and drinks in a beautiful setting .
the service was terrible , we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served .
other than being a little crowded and a bit over ##pr ##ice ##d , the atmosphere is filled with energy ( and the beautiful people of course ) and the food was surprising good !
the music is the best among all the indian restaurants i have visited .
the bread and lamb chop ##s i had before the meal were quite good , however .
rao ' ##s has the best service and atmosphere in nyc .
they never brought us compliment ##ary noodles , ignored repeated requests for sugar , and threw our dishes on the table .
excellent dump ##lings served amid clean , chi ##c decor .
the kitchen however , is almost always slow .
cute place , nice wait staff but would never go there again .
people are rude bit again it ' ##s new york !
the plain slice is great and if you get topping ##s , the whole slice is topped with them , not sparsely sp ##rin ##kled on like some places .
service was also horrible and the am ##bie ##nce is not that great .
service is great , take ##out is good too .
everything is excellent , the menu is quite extensive , and you eat with a view on both sides of the city .
for the quality of food , a little too expensive .
here ' ##s to the fake fish tanks too ...
i ' ##ve never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious .
we decided to eat in tea room which was small and cute .
what an amazing meal and experience !
unique app ##pet ##izer ##s .
the staff has always been at ##ten ##tive and kind , and i ' ##ve always been amazed at how they ' ##ve handled all the various different group sizes that come in .
it is the best deal in town for a monday night dinner at a fine restaurant .
the wait here is long for dim sum , but if you do n ##' ##t like sharing tables or if the typical ra ##uc ##ous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig , this is a sleek ( for chinatown ) alternative .
this place has good potential , but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on indian food you can get everywhere else .
everything is always cooked to perfection , the service is excellent , the decor cool and under ##sta ##ted .
the thai food is good .
great selection of wine , and seafood .
acceptable prices .
as i made the title , it ' ##s an affordable restaurant for great taste .
definitely not worth the price !
or ##say , is a very pleasant throw back to traditional french food , and french service as well .
it ' ##s easy to get a table for a large group and you do n ##' ##t get hu ##stle ##d out .
great food at reasonable prices .
salad ##s are a delicious way to begin the meal .
i ordered tam ##ari ##nd duck and my wife ordered noodles with ground beef , and we were both delighted by the way the dishes ev ##oked thai flavors in unexpected ways .
the prices are about $ 9 for an en ##tree for dinner and even less for lunch .
should you happen to be impressed by the cuisine definitely try it .
i had the black cod with yu ##zu sauce , which was wonderful .
prices too high for this cramped and una ##ppe ##aling rest ##ura ##nt .
total hips ##ter ##- ##wan ##na ##be attitude in an otherwise sweet spot .
everything , from the soft bread , so ##ggy salad , and 50 minute wait time , with an incredibly rude service to deliver below average food .
the sicilian is my favorite it is moist not dry like most places but all their pizza is great !
the menu prices are a bit expensive for what you get in quality and portion size .
the food was amazing , and the service was prompt and helpful , but not over ##- ##be ##aring or rushed .
( food was delivered by a bus ##boy , not waiter ) we got no cheese offered for the pasta , our water and wine glasses remained empty our entire meal , when we would have easily spent another $ 20 on wine .
the take ##out is great too since they give high quality tu ##pper ##ware as well .
the food was not fresh , the sauce ##s were bland and very oil ##y .
this is definitely an excellent date spot because of the am ##bian ##ce and on the weekends the night scene is more than alive .
again , the waitress was awesome .
i loved every ##thi ##g about it ##- ##es ##pe ##cial ##ly the shows and actors .
the service was fast and friendly and the food was very ta ##sty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals .
sc ##ali ##na fed ##eli reminded me why service is so integral to fine dining .
i recommend the thai popcorn : )
everything looks great , the drinks , the decor , the food , even the people .
the para ##tha ##s and ke ##ba ##bs are made when ordered ensuring a level of fresh ##ness that is un ##sur ##pass ##ed .
the tuna and was ##abe potatoes are excellent .
the only disappointment was the coat check girls who did n ##' ##t seem to know what a customer is on a real ##tively non ##- ##bus ##y night ( for the coat check girls ) .
we had great dessert ##s ( including the best can ##no ##li i ' ##ve ever had ) and then they offered an after dinner drink , on the house .
good crowd , good outdoor seating , with a hip japanese vibe .
we asked to be moved ( which took half an hour ) , and then were seated in a high traffic area in the back , even though the rest of the room was practically empty .
however , their popularity has yet to slow down , and i still find myself drawn to their am ##bian ##ce and del ##ect ##able reputation .
where tanks in other chinatown restaurants display a lurking myriad of sad ##- ##lo ##oki ##ng marine life in their mu ##rky waters , the tanks at ping ' ##s are clear as glass with healthy ##- ##lo ##oki ##ng creatures who do not yet know that they will be part of some dim sum lover ' ##s br ##un ##ch .
the hal ##ib ##ut was too salty , dessert was so so ( do n ##' ##t waste any of your cal ##ories ) and service was poor .
the view is spectacular , and the food is great .
good bag ##els and good cream cheese .
the food is wonderful , ta ##sty and filling , and the service is professional and friendly .
it is also extremely well priced .
always great service !
i loved the shows .
we could have made a meal of the yu ##mmy dump ##lings from the dump ##ling menu .
then , get ripped on free box wine .
my wife and i ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ran ##ting and ravi ##ng about the food .
the food itself was just ok - nothing spectacular - but the service was awful .
the pizza is yu ##mmy and i like the atm ##osh ##per ##e .
also , do n ##' ##t plan on asking for your favorite roll , if it ' ##s not on the menu , you ca n ##' ##t have it .
good food .
those rolls were big , but not good and sash ##imi was n ##' ##t fresh .
try the spicy shrimp app ##eti ##zer ( again , not the greatest value in the world but worth the price ) and the lamb vin ##dal ##oo is great .
food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit
i have had so many dinners here and it ' ##s always been perfect - on a date with my husband , with my mom , with girlfriends and larger groups .
the menu has lots of options : i hope to go back to try those potato pancakes .
the staff is n ##' ##t the friend ##liest or most competent , and i am stick ##ler for service , but everything else about this place makes up for it .
my wife and i will usually only order one pri ##mi and one second ##i and split them , as they tend to offer large portions .
delicious crab cakes too .
i have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at la lantern ##a .
the br ##us ##chet ##ta and pan ##ini ' ##s are so yu ##mmy !
always popular , always full , always a wait .
if the om ##aka ##se is to showcase technique and variety , serving almost 40 % of items bb ##q ##- ##ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not ##- ##so ##- ##fr ##esh nor ##i seems to be a rather limp performance .
i ca n ##' ##t wait for summer , when they serve outside on their gigantic patio .
best past ##ram ##i i ever had and great portion without being ridiculous .
the first 2 courses were very good , but the chocolate sample ##r was too rich for me and the dessert wine far too sweet .
butter was melted , white wine warm , cheese o ##oz ##ing everywhere .
we had a party in their private room and they made it truly memorable and were very helpful in the planning .
it can not be the am ##bie ##nce , because the place is very cramped and some guests have to sit in an aisle .
we were disappointed with the pre ##- ##fi ##x ##e menu of only 2 choices per course ( other restaurants offer 3 choices ) and ended up ordering a la cart ##e .
authentic pakistani food .
the staff has always been friendly without seeming gr ##ating , and the chef has greeted us on a couple of occasions .
the egg ##pl ##ant par ##mes ##an is also great , and my friend who grew up in manhattan claims that no one serves a better baked z ##iti with meat ##sau ##ce .
quality ingredients preparation all around , and a very fair price for nyc .
service was very good - prompt , at ##ten ##tive and non ##- ##int ##rus ##ive .
my en ##tree of hot pot with seafood was full of imitation crab ##me ##at with a couple pieces of shrimp and squid , and was un ##ne ##ces ##sari ##ly heated with a burn ##er .
in such a crap ##py part of town to find a good value for lunch , this place is great .
in fact , while leaving the place we saw two people looking at the menu , and i could n ##' ##t help telling them that the food was horrible .
even though the restaurant was packed , we were seated promptly and even asked for a table upstairs with no problems .
service is friendly , prices are good - delivery time was a little slow , but for the way this pizza tastes , i ' ##m willing to overlook it .
the food can get price ##y but the prix ##e fix ##e tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food all ##er ##gies or food you do n ##' ##t like .
the service is excellent , the decor is great , and the food is delicious and comes in large portions .
an excellent service
i love their thai noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the must !
the pizza was really good .
the only possible draw ##back to this last point is that as of the date of this posting , the additional menu items are only written in chinese .
ko ##sher dil ##ls are the perfect compliment for your un ##for ##get ##able sandwich and they give you plenty of them .
the food is so cheap and the waiter ##s are nice .
the food there is so good that even to order out the wait is incredible .
their su ##shi , kam ##ika ##ze and other rolls are fresh and well presented .
for authentic thai food , look no further than too ##ns .
the highlight of the night was the mayo ##nais ##se for my side of fries i received from one of the food runners , which is not good considering the bill was nearly $ 100 .
i choose to go with one of the special , the bra ##ised lamb shan ##k in red wine , which was excellent .
small serving ##s for main en ##tree , i had salmon ( wasn ##t impressed ) girlfriend had chicken , it was good .
the food is very good for it ' ##s price , better than most fried dump ##lings i ' ##ve had .
ob ##v ca ##via ##r is top of the line but the rest of the menu is so diverse it gives you a chance to taste so many ##di ##ffer ##ent variety ##s .
i ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive .
still , try it once , since if you end up loving the food , it could be one of your best dining experiences .
other guests enjoyed pizza , santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips .
not only does make the best pizza in ny , maybe anywhere .
the spicy tuna roll is huge and probably the best that i ' ##ve had at this price range .
our waiter and all of the people helping him were at ##ten ##tive and genuine .
the place is a bis ##tro which means : simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bust ##ling atmosphere .
this is one of the best comfort food places in the city .
i had a huge past ##ram ##i sandwich on a roll .
though you will undoubtedly be seated at a table with what seems like barely enough room ( no matter what the size of your party ) , the warm atom ##osphere is worth the cramped quarters ##- you ' ##ll have fun and forgot about the tight spot you ' ##re in .
the fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale .
besides , when you have bad service , that ' ##s less money you have to tip .
the wine list is also really nice .
service was devin ##e , oyster ##s where a sensual as they come , and the price ca n ##' ##t be beat ! ! !
compared to es ##s ##- ##a , tal offers a less dough ##y bag ##el !
ball ##ato ' ##s is consistently delicious authentic italian food .
the service was at ##ten ##tive , yet discreet .
they offer the same menu but have creative drinks that are loaded with alcohol and cheek ##y names - ##- but they do cost you .
we went to eat at the je ##ky ##ll and hyde restaurant on friday night and really enjoyed the fun atmosphere and good food .
unless you are eating in the pi ##zz ##eria side of this place , and are not in a rush , this place is a bad idea .
am ##bian ##ce is barely romantic but management tries .
i must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small ( especially the app ##eti ##zers ) , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef ' ##s special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an app ##eti ##zer ( 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing ) , a main en ##tree , and the cold ud ##on at the end of the meal .
after we got our sash ##imi order , i could not believe how small the portions were !
nothing better than buying a snap ##ple for $ 3 ##. ##25 too .
the dos ##as are ski ##mp ##y , una ##tt ##ractive and drip with grease , and personally i ' ##d drink popcorn topping before i ' ##d eat another one of these .
the service was excellent and the food was delicious .
if i wanted to deal with a crap ##py scene and annoying customers i ' ##d go out in manhattan .
until you realize that their five minutes is meaningless and your wait may be anywhere from two to twenty minutes it may be frustrating .
tha ##lia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you , but the food does n ##' ##t quite match up .
the filling ##s may be unconventional but the dos ##a batter is definitely authentic and the combinations very ta ##sty .
this is the perfect spot for meeting friends , having lunch , dinner , pre ##- ##the ##at ##re or after ##- ##the ##at ##re drinks !
the mu ##ssa ##man curry that i ordered was as thin as water and aside from the poorly fried to ##fu that i ordered in it , they gr ##acious ##ly provided me with one piece of poorly cooked potato .
well , this place is so ghetto its not even funny .
we would like to thank marcelo and grace for a wonderful dining experience ! ! !
found service above average , but that could be because we were 13 of us .
bag ##els are ok , but be sure not to make any special requests !
fine dining restaurant quality .
overall a disappointing experience for that price category .
the food was exceptional .
the portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that .
( and i have eaten my share ) which impress ##es me for having such a large amount of people to serve .
sure , the setting is nice .
slightly above average wines start at $ 70 ##+ with only one selection listed at $ 30 ##+ .
their white ##fish salad is excellent - ##- all white ##fish with a little mayo .
the chicken par ##m was edible but had canned tomato sauce and boxed pasta and the chicken with porto ##bell ##o mushrooms consisted of dry , in ##ed ##ible chicken with terrible sauce .
i recommend this place to everyone who asks me where to go for a good meal .
the waitress ##es are nice - ##- also you can just get counter service sit .
the only friendly staff member was the guy at the bar .
you can certainly find restaurants that offer a superior fine dining experience , but for superb food at reasonable prices , la villa ca n ##' ##t be beat .
i can not imagine a friend ##lier staff working in a restaurant .
i do suggest to ask to be seated upstairs if you are looking to be a little cozy .
the red curry is weak and taste ##less , the pad thai is stuck together and lump ##y , the rice is often over ##co ##oked , and the seafood is pretty sketch ##y .
the wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal .
saul is pretty good , but definitely not great .
i would recommend roxy ' ##s for that , but not for their food .
it is nearly impossible to get a table , so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner , do not pass it up .
their pad penang is delicious and everything else is fantastic .
the pu ##ke green walls leave a lot to be desired , but the food is very good .
the flavors are very fresh and pretty uno ##bt ##rus ##ive , nothing flash ##y .
i like cafe noir don ##t get me wrong , it is j ##su ##t that the people who work there are evil and inc ##omp ##ete ##nt ! !
the hang ##er steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavor ##less not to mention it tasted like it had just been tha ##wed .
our son loves pizza and we have a certified ne ##ap ##oli ##tan pizza ##ria in our home city ( seattle ) , we liked this nearly as much - and the differences were more about personal preference than any reflection on either restaurant .
big and soft as well as good lunch food .
no food s ##nob ##s allowed , this place is for people who appreciate good food .
i liked the food at this quasi ##- ##tha ##i restaurant .
as for the bar , this is another bad idea .
the bare ##be ##cu ##ed salmon is elegant ##ly spice ##d and not at all dry .
the highly spice ##d cha ##i tea was great too .
seriously , this is the best all you can eat in town ##- as everyone says , the spicy tuna hand rolls are the best ##- have 4 of these , and you ' ##ve broken even .
while sapphire is certainly not lacking in am ##bian ##ce , and probably has the best decor of any indian restaurant i have been to in new york city , the food was not what i had hoped for .
i would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a casual atmosphere that w ##his ##ks you away to the left bank of the river seine .
his wife tanya , the hostess , completes the comforting atmosphere by being delightful ##ly warm and gr ##acious .
i have been a longtime fan of holy basil in the east village , and while i do believe their food has slightly slipped in quality , i have been hesitant to be di ##sl ##oya ##l .
but the best part about l ##s is the late night atmosphere , delightful ##ly free of the bt ##s .
the staff there is very at ##ten ##tive and down to earth .
you do n ##' ##t go to mi ##zu for excellent service , you go for the large amounts of food , the ami ##able atmosphere , and the hole ##- ##in ##- ##the ##- ##wall feeling of the place .
the service is decent even when this small place is packed .
this is the best su ##shi in new york city - hands down .
great value for the quality ingredients .
the tha ##li was small , thoroughly un ##rem ##ark ##able , and $ 14 ##. ##9 ##5 .
truly the mark of an at ##ten ##tive waiter .
the food here is rather good , but only if you like to wait for it .
i got an excellent piece of cheese ##cake and we had several other nice past ##ries .
the staff is very kind and well trained , they ' ##re fast , they are always prompt to jump behind the bar and fix drinks , they know details of every item in the menu and make excellent rec ##ome ##nda ##tions .
the food is in ##vent ##ive but still keeps traditional indian flavor ##ing .
the decor in this place is very diner ##- ##ish and the kind of place you expect in the east village - not romantic , just simple , small and sparse .
this is a cute place and could be good but they need to get their act together .
the lo ##x is always fresh too .
so all i ' ##m trying to say is this restaurant is by far the best thai food restaurant i ' ##ve ever been to .
food was ok - fish was cooked well .
the duck con ##fi ##t is always amazing and the f ##oi ##e gr ##as terri ##ne with fig ##s was out of this world .
the whole set up is truly un ##pro ##fe ##ssion ##al and i wish cafe noir would get some good staff , because despite the current one this is a great place .
the staff offers imp ##ec ##cable service .
we ended our great experience by having gu ##lab jam ##un ( dessert ) recommended by the waiter .
the place is sleek , modern and playful and i will return again frequently .
the br ##io ##che and lo ##llie ##s as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal .
the service was at ##ten ##tive , yet un ##im ##po ##sing , the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced .
salad ##s were fantastic .
the owners and employees are friendly and their pizza is fantastic .
the food is yu ##mmy , especially their cooked ##- ##to ##- ##per ##fect ##ion mu ##ssel ##s in spicy tomato sauce and their shoes ##tri ##ng crisp ##y fries .
fast service .
the staff is excellent , special : that girl behind the bar , european chi ##c .
the service was bad , the food took to forever to come , we sat on the upper level .
we a menu that rarely changes , e x ##ce ##pt for one or two specials , the quality and care they put in th ##ier food in evident .
stick to dim ##sum , not super over ##pr ##ice ##d noodles .
the service is fine and they allow you to enjoy the view .
we , there were four of us , arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude .
delicious simple food in nice outdoor atmosphere .
the only fall ##back on this restaurant is the prices .
the hot and sour soup was un ##be ##ara ##bly hot and tasted of only pepper and nothing else .
the food is delicious .
their wines by the glass are a great accompaniment and you can eat like a king with wine for under $ 30 .
this place has the the correct am ##bie ##nce and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time .
the atmosphere is much better than sri ##pr ##ap ##hai ( more modern and sleek ) .
the food is outstanding and the service is quick , friendly and very professional .
the bag ##els always warm , soft on the inside , crisp ##y on the outside and enormous in size .
i had a late dinner at lucky st ##ike , a great name for a joint if ever i saw one .
service is fast and friendly .
and they have these home made potato chips at the bar that are the most delicious things in the world !
my husband and i enjoyed each of the 6 taste size portions and left completely full .
we all ate pasta en ##tre ##' ##es , which were great .
the steak was excellent and one of the best i have had ( i tasted the butter int ##ital ##ly but in no way did it over ##w ##helm the flavor of the meat ) .
the food was boring and expensive .
the am ##bie ##nce is pretty and nice for conversation , so a casual lunch here would probably be best .
terrific menu full of unique rolls and special dishes .
the service is ok but could be better .
we love the food , drinks , and atmosphere !
i was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever .
took my mom for mother ' ##s day , and the mai ##tre d ' was pretty rude .
the vibe is very relaxed and cozy , service was great and the food was excellent !
the service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual .
i recommend their pad see e ##w , pork chop ##s or to ##fu plates .
this is the best secret place in midtown ' , i heard that from the bartender , after having brilliant food ( try steak with porto ##bell ##o mushrooms ) and drinks on the bar last tuesday .
the service was excellent - friendly and at ##ten ##tive .
the dinner menu is diverse and top ##- ##not ##ch as well .
i do n ##' ##t like indian food too much and this was delicious , however you want to factor that into the equation .
at ta ##j , vegetarian ##s can re ##jo ##ice ##- ##all the dishes are mann ##a from heaven .
jimmy ' ##s is hands down the hottest night spot in the bronx .
the $ 300 bill was a bit steep , but the experience was great .
nice am ##bian ##ce , nice little bar , good bartender , francois , and good service .
the cal ##ama ##ri comes with an incredible sauce , and the duck noodles are yu ##mmy as well .
i would definitely go back - ##- if only for some of those exotic martini ##s on the black ##board .
simple comfort food and what hot and large portions .
the bag ##els are also reasonably priced for nyc .
decor leaves something to be desired .
also , specify if you like your food spicy ##- its rather bland if you do n ##' ##t .
our waiter was fine , the place looks nice in that not ##- ##try ##ing ##- ##to ##o ##- ##hard way , but at those prices , a little more should be expected of your food .
i ' ##ve been to this restaurant more than a dozen times and when i ' ##m craving for ph ##o , lemon grass chicken or beef cube on rice , this is the place to go .
oh yes , and if you are a fan of indian oldies film stars , there are plenty of portraits of indian actors and actresses in classic black white that ad ##orn the walls , some of which , i would love to know where they obtained .
the food is spectacular , from the app ##iti ##zers to the main course , and then of course the dessert ##s , ( wow ) you ' ##ll need no more .
my fish was delicious in an incredible curry sauce .
if you are in search of the most authentic nyc del ##i experience look no further than the famous and historic katz ' ##s del ##i down on the lower east side .
even upon delivery , their juicy pork bun ##s are quite good . .
average to good thai food , but terrible delivery .
joe ' ##s pizza used to have the best slice until this pi ##zz ##eria opened up .
and they provided a delicious dessert on the house !
they are still living in the dark ages and do not have an answering machine , so if you want to make a reservation you are limited .
the food is amazing , rich pasta ##s and fresh dough ##y pizza .
food was very good , but not what i would consider out of this world .
try the pad thai , it ' ##s fabulous and their prices are so cheap !
food is great and inexpensive .
dessert - ca n ##' ##t be missed , so save room ! ! !
ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me .
it was so bad i actually refused to pay for my food .
i recommend this spot to anyone who enjoys fine cuisine at reasonable prices .
the staff was very at ##ten ##tive , the am ##bie ##nce lovely , and the food superb .
i love when restaurants think using fancy expensive ing ##red ##ian ##ts makes the food fine cuisine , even with no idea how to use them .
the pizza and wine were excellent - ##the service too - ##- but what really made this place was the backyard dining area .
the service was superb , they treat you like family .
we all had the tasting menu and unlike some of the other reviews , i felt there was more than enough food .
the menu may be small , but everything on it is delicious .
they had scrapped the bottom of the vessel in which they make the rice - ##res ##ult - we had large chunks of burnt rice in our serving bowl .
warm , comfortable surroundings , nice appointments ( witness the etched glass and brick ##work separating the dining rooms ) .
the well manner ##ed , pleasant staff that tony has in his employ .
all i can say is $ 2 pin ##ts during happy hour and the some of the cheap ##est oyster ##s you ' ##ll find in the city , though the quality is some of the best .
i would never wait for a table to eat , it just is not that great .
we concluded with ti ##ram ##is ##u chocolate cake , both were delicious .
the counter service is bad .
service here was great , food was fantastic .
the sauce is delicious and the crust is perfect .
you will pay a lot for the decor ##e , but the food is no better or worse than a lot of other chinese and asian fusion places in ny .
they have some great en ##tree ##s here as well .
the service is not consistently excellent - ##- just decent .
the food , served in small tasting portions ( as an option ) is very good with each dish being better than the next .
i had the mango chicken and i ca n ##' ##t go on to tell you how delicious that was and the presentation was beautiful .
food and service was okay .
the best pad thai i ' ##ve ever had .
great pizza and fantastic service .
while this is a pretty place in that overly cute french way , the food was insulting ##ly horrible .
i went there for lunch and it was not as good as i expected from the reviews i read .
the wine list is n ##' ##t great , and the dessert ##s are shipped in from bruno ' ##s down the street , which is not as good as it used to be .
their coffee is quite good too !
great wine list ( italian ) , good food , service was initially fine .
despite the fact that the space is large , they ' ##ve over ##crow ##ded the floor with tables .
they are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret cho ##sing this place , but also become hostile !
normally that would be improper , however they were all delicious and my host did not complain .
taxa ##n delicious !
unlike other places in nyc where the sandwiches you want only come as a triple ##- ##deck ##er , here you can get what you want in a reasonably ##- ##si ##zed portion ( and price ) .
restaurant s ##nob ##s need not bother , this is a small , neighborhood kind of place .
they could n ##' ##t even make a salad that was appealing .
of course the reason its so packed is because the food is so delicious !
staff ##s are not that friendly , but the taste covers all .
the waiter was at ##ten ##tive .
their margarita is best i ' ##ve had since i ' ##ve returned from naples !
their sake list was extensive , but we were looking for purple haze , which was n ##' ##t listed but made for us upon request !
the tables are cr ##ammed way too close , the menu is typical of any italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply over ##pr ##ice ##d .
the food was actually awful .
they are served with a free app ##eti ##zer and the portions are perfect for lunch .
there is actually space to breathe and the decor sets the tone for an intimate dinner .
we went around 9 ##: ##30 on a friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great !
my husband and i both ordered the steak , medium .
this place has real ##y fresh su ##shi and a nice large menu of japanese classic cuisine .
the su ##shi is average and the prices are anything but .
my wife and i also enjoyed the spin ##ach , the shanghai low mein , and other attractions .
turned out there was full service upstairs and sat down .
if you have a dump ##ling fe ##tish i suggest you try some here !
the food is consistently wonderful - i ' ##ve been coming here for years , and the owner has always been acc ##omo ##dating and friendly .
the waiter ##s and owners were non ##chal ##ant about this and promised to call the ex ##ter ##mina ##tor but were n ##' ##t as dismay ##ed or apologetic as i would have expected .
and the food was fantastic .
aside from the sea ur ##chin , the chef recommended an assortment of fish including fatty yellow tail , bot ##on shrimp , blue fin tor ##ro ( fatty tuna ) , sea eel , etc .
they ' ##re also friend ##lier here , especially the owner , kenny .
while the room is not particularly comfortable , once you ' ##re seated you ' ##ll forget about everything except what ' ##s on your plate .
the am ##bian ##ce is minimal the food is not phenomena ##l , but some dishes are quite good , such as the egg ##pl ##ant par ##mes ##an , ve ##al in car ##oz ##za chicken salt ##im ##bo ##cca .
the bar has various selections and the mixed drink special is a catcher ! 2 for 1 ' ##s .
during the course of the past 3 months , the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better .
i like the am ##bie ##nce , it ' ##s very dark and original .
overall , not worth the money .
this place is not worth the prices .
pick a bag ##el has the best bag ##els in the city .
yes you have to wait to be seated and because its small there is no waiting area and the seat at the bar was all taken .
the last two times i ordered from here my food was soo spicy that i could barely eat it , and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish .
the fried dump ##lings are great !
we figured we never had argent ##inian pizza before so we grabbed our lunch there , sharing a large pe ##lli ##grin ##o , a pizza of two of their specials , one was goat cheese the other blue cheese , and both were excellent .
the ' kam ##as ##ut ##ra ' and ' bombay cosmopolitan ' are excellent and will have you tips ##y in no time .
this is the perfect date spot for williamsburg couples .
the dim sum here is only so ##- ##so .
service was slow , but the people were friendly .
the steak was very fatty and the sauce was over ##powering and not very ta ##sty .
the staff makes you feel at home , the food is great and the atmosphere is wonderful !
the food is alright - some stuff is good - some is not ( like the steak dish which tends to be dry ) .
they have a very diverse menu so its something for everybody .
the staff was too busy ordering su ##shi for dinner and then laying it out to eat on the bar to even bring me my check .
the bag ##el was huge .
the staff has been nice , but they seemed really stressed and the un ##ise ##x bathroom needs to be cleaned more often .
the service was the only thing good about this restaurant .
service - ##- friendly and at ##ten ##tive .
great food , great decor , great service .
and , at ##lho ##ugh tables opened up next to us and we asked for a slightly larger space , they left us aw ##kar ##dly seated .
the pal ##ak pan ##eer was standard , and i was not a fan of the mala ##i ko ##ft ##a .
i ' ##ve din ##ed at alain duc ##asse ' ##s restaurant in monte carlo for half the price for the same excellent dining experience .
there was no am ##bian ##ce .
save your money and do n ##' ##t waste your cal ##ories , go to mar ##gh ##ari ##ta ' ##s on washington street instead , they have amazing food and the best service .
the only weird thing was if we got a bottle , the waitress would have simply multiplied the glass price x ##4 , which makes no sense whatsoever .
they sell special su ##shi , everything have a topping , sauce and etc .
the place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded , but the service is excellent and it ' ##s great for friends out , a romantic date , or a special o ##cca ##ssion .
the service was excellent and the food was delicious .
service was also very good .
i took my girlfriend there for her birthday last night and we had a relaxing , really good meal .
i ' ##m happy to have nos ##h in the neighborhood and the food is very comforting .
good atmosphere , combination of all the hottest music dress code is relatively strict except on fridays .
love the food .
i would highly recommend nina ' ##s to anyone who wants to have a romantic dinner in a heart warming surrounding filled with candles and family pictures .
there ' ##s something smooth about sipping sake upper east side style .
it ' ##s a nice place to relax and have conversation .
best reuben sandwich ever !
lucky strike is a great casual place to just grab a bite to eat .
going to vol ##are is like going to your favorite aunt ' ##s house for dinner , assuming that your aunt is a great italian cook .
the su ##shi has been from average to below average , the wait service has always been sub ##par the atmosphere goes from nice to really irritating ( if you sit in the area beyond the kitchen , the ac ##ous ##it ##cs are ho ##rri ##d , everything echoes is extremely loud ) .
fr ##ites were delicious if a bit on the thick side .
i would recommend putting your name down and then getting a drink at a local bar first though because of the wait time .
i fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef bro ##th with shrimp dump ##lings and slices of bb ##q roast pork .
overall , the best bag ##el in town .
light , refreshing summer rolls ( not fried ) remind me of vietnamese places in paris .
the su ##shi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportion ##ed .
but the service was a bit slow .
spreads and topping ##s are great - though a bit price ##y .
indoor was very cozy and cute .
we had a 3 hour br ##un ##ch ##- they definitely do not rush you ##- and they kept the unlimited mi ##mos ##as flowing the whole time .
the service was excellent , the food was excellent , but the entire experience was very cool .
the service is good and the rest ##ura ##nt is clean .
the cafe itself was really nice with comfortable outdoor chairs and tables , but the service could have been better .
i ' ##ve rarely had a problem with slow staff in the 10 years i ' ##ve been going .
food is excellent .
although we were looking for regular let ##tu ##ce and some walnut ##s the salad ##s we got were great .
excellent lunch buffet for only $ 6 ##. ##9 ##5 .
am ##bie ##nce is so cute and qu ##aint , good for business although we were there on vacation .
the portion sizes here are huge , and the su ##shi is good .
good food at the restaurant ( a bit expensive , but great if you want to impress your date ) .
i highly recommend ca ##via ##r russ ##e to anyone who wants delicious top grade ca ##via ##r and fantastic service .
i have eaten there 3 ##- ##4 times and the food was always good .
grille ##d whole fish wonderful , great sp ##icing .
for years , i thought tu ##scan cuisine was the best , but salvatore converted me to the heart ##y ne ##ap ##oli ##tan fare on my first visit .
the service was great as well .
another plus is most of the en ##tree ##s are approx .
from the moment we walked in they were more than acc ##omo ##dating even though the place was packed .
i found the food , service and value exceptional every ##time i have been there .
we ate at this thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods .
the food is definitely good , but i left a bit disappointed .
the drinks are a saving grace , but service staff , please , get over yourselves .
there is a downs ##ide if you ' ##re ordering in - ##- the delivery guys have major attitude .
the all ##- ##ital ##ian staff is warm and engaging from the start .
the prices are exceptionally reasonable for food of this caliber .
the file ##t mig ##non dish was superb !
i had been a regular due to the consistently good food and ease of getting a table .
i did n ##' ##t expect to like nos ##h as much as i did , but the past ##ram ##i on cha ##llah sandwich i had was other ##world ##ly , the soup ##s are like mom ' ##s , and the kn ##ish ##es give yo ##nah sc ##him ##mel ' ##s a run for its money .
the atmosphere is nothing special , but it feels like a su ##shi establishment in tokyo .
cozy romantic atom ##osphere with only around 15 tables at most .
this place is worth going even if only for their beer .
the am ##bie ##nce was so fun , and the prices were great , on top of the fact that the food was really ta ##sty .
the sand ##w ##hic ##hes are out of this world !
decor is charming .
the food was very well prepared .
good , because hey , it ' ##s more food , but bad because dim sum is supposed to be smaller portions so you can try out more dishes and smaller so that each dish is cheap .
while most people can at ##test to spending over $ 50 on drinks in new york bars and hardly feeling a thing , the drinks here are pl ##ent ##iful and unique .
compliment ##ary stuff kept coming , and when the waiter saw me opening a gift , i received my dessert on a plate that had happy birthday written on it , with a candle ##very nice touch , and at ##ten ##tive staff .
the food arrived 20 minutes after i called , cold and so ##ggy .
if you go for the pre ##- ##the ##at ##re menu , it ' ##s an even greater deal .
if you are someone who appreciate ##s simplicity , elegance , and wonderful ##ly presented and tasting seafood and vegetables regardless of portion size , kai is your place .
we usually just get some of the dinner specials and they are very reasonably priced and very ta ##sty .
horrible food and horrible service .
they treated us well and the food was extremely fresh and well ##- ##pre ##par ##ed .
their exotic salad is basic l ##y a delicious little green salad with a peanut sauce that is perfect before their sweet basil fried to ##fu .
even if the food was n ##' ##t this good , the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax .
vol ##are virgin ##s or weekly regulars , everyone gets treated the same and you ca n ##' ##t ask for more than that when the service is this friendly .
the food came out wrong , the waiter was no where to be found and the wine showed up at the end of the meal .
the chicken and steak were seasoned and cooked to perfection , and the lamb sand ##w ##hic ##h is great for heart ##ier appetite ##s .
the food was great and the service was even better .
while this can hardly be called a restaurant , it is possibly the best deal in man ##hat ##ten : $ 4 for a plate heap ##ed with rice and 2 ##- ##3 en ##tree ##s .
traditional french deco ##ur was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation .
my son and his girlfriend both wanted cheese ##burg ##ers and they were huge !
i really recommend the very simple und ##a ( egg ) rolls .
very good wine choices .
this is the only thai place i go too in nyc , it ' ##s wonderful , and live relaxed jazz on certain nights .
we were seated and ignored by waits ##taff .
ta ##sty steak , pork lo ##in , the works .
i ' ##d highly recommend it for a special occasion - ##- it provides and intimate setting and nice service .
the burger was great , also .
they did give a 15 % discount at the end , was n ##' ##t enough , as they knew the service was horrible .
the pizza was great .
i had never had ed ##ama ##me pure ##ed before but i thought it was innovative and ta ##sty ( could ' ##ve used a bit more salt ) .
however , it ' ##s the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth .
the price was extremely reasonable for the app ##eti ##zers and food we ate .
do n ##' ##t din ##e at tam ##ari ##nd for the vegetarian dishes , they are simply not up to par with the non ##- ##ve ##g selections .
they need a kick out of it but until then the su ##shi is pretty good and the place is consistent .
i ' ##ve had to wait only a few times during lunch but this place is definitely worth the wait .
all in all the food was above average and i would return to see how they operate with four or less dinners .
delicious food , excellent service , and a pretty atmosphere make this a great choice for dinner and the $ 5 ##. ##9 ##9 lunch buffet makes it an even better choice for lunch !
for app ##eti ##zers , i recommend the shrimp fr ##itte ##rs and dump ##lings .
such nice people working here - but i have to review the food .
the restaurant is dark and not very attractive and then you have spot lights shining on you putting you in the worst light possible , reaching for sunglasses .
great wine , great food .
the service was med ##io ##cre , and the lack of air conditioning made for a less than comfortable meal .
the food and staff always surprise me with the new heights they are taken to .
honestly the worst su ##shi my husband and i had in our entire lives .
however , if you want great food at a great price and do n ##' ##t mind the decor , you ca n ##' ##t beat this place .
what makes this restaurant special are the authentic sichuan cooking and being the only one in nyc that offers authentic chong ##qing hot ##pot .
interesting other dishes for a change include chicken in curry sauce and salmon case ##rol ##e .
one of my favorites though was the angry lobster , a cold lobster salad that was magnificent .
ask for us ##ha , the nice ##st bartender in manhattan .
the service is outstanding and my crab ##- ##cake eggs benedict could not have been better .
the place ' ##s decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh .
its location is good and the fact that hut ##ner college is near and their prices are very reasonable , makes students go back to su ##an again and again .
deliveries often take up to an hour and the prices are higher than most other pi ##zz ##eria ##s in the area .
because of the delicate thin crust , take ##- ##out pie ##s get so ##ggy in their boxes .
this place is always very crowded and popular .
the selection changes frequently but the basic dishes are always available .
i have to say that if this what makes it easier to get a sa ##et a lunch - ##- i don ##t mind .
we were told that they were booked solid and no other table was available .
after dealing with sub ##par pizza all over the kensington neighborhood - i ' ##ve found little toni ##nos .
each table has a pot of boiling water sunken into its surface , and you get platt ##ers of thin sliced meat ##s , various vegetables , and rice and glass noodles .
