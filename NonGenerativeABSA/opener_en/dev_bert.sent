[unused] very warm welcome at the reception , very friendly and helpful personnel , especially at the bar and during breakfast , a really good experience overall , had a relaxing drink at the bar , visited the cigarrum smokers lounge and had a great start into the day at the very nicely assorted breakfast buffet .
[unused] The room is very small , about 10m2
[unused] Hotel Premiere Classe Orly Rungis is near the airport and close to Orly major highways ( all night heard the noise of passing large vehicles ) .
[unused] Near the hotel there is a bus stop that goes to the RER station .
[unused] In this area there is famous Rungis market , the largest food market in the world .
[unused] Transfer from the airport to the hotel we had a free ( ask about a transfer at the information desk at the airport ) .
[unused] Minibus goes from the airport to a hotel .

[unused] We enjoyed the time on the beach and the friendliness of the people working there .
[unused] Fantastic food , breathtaken view from the bar .
[unused] Great music and moments that we will always remember .
[unused] See you next year .
[unused] Overnight
[unused] We stayed in this hotel as we arrived quite late in the day on out inbound flight from our summer holiday .
[unused] It is situated in Frankfurt Flughaven railway station , so as one might expect transport connections are superb .
[unused] The check in was quick and efficient , just what you need after a long flight .
[unused] The room was adequate .
[unused] We ordered room service .
[unused] The food came quickly , was hot , tasty , and expensive , very expensive .
[unused] Over 40 Euros for a pizza , burger and two drinks .
[unused] However the room only cost 75 Euros for the night .
[unused] One of the cleanest Travelodges I 've been to !
[unused] This Travelodge is well placed in the City Centre and a short walk from the station and a short walk to the shops , restaurants etc. that Leeds has to offer .
[unused] The rooms are one of the cleanest Travelodges I 've been too however the corridors and reception area is a little rough from all of the Hen / Stag weekend traffic .
[unused] There were a few Stag weekenders checking in when we were however we didn 't experience any noise or unpleasantness that would stop us from coming back in the future for our city breaks to Leeds .
[unused] It a good location , basic , clean and thats all I can ask for for the price .
[unused] Excellent beach resort
[unused] Very large resort hotel but we were upgraded to suites on arrival , however these were an extremely long walk from the restaurant / reception approx 500 metres .
[unused] When walking problem were presented to the General Manager Mr Y. A. we were moved to two adjacent family rooms closer to these facilities and also given the blue bands allocated to repeat visitors , he could not have been more helpful .
[unused] It is a shame that given such ehormous pool area there is more unheated than heated and that would be my only complaint about the actual hotel facilities .
[unused] I would highly recommend this resort especially compared with ones in Sharm .
[unused] Tip top · top tip !
[unused] I have to say that I 've had a very nice holiday in this hotel .
[unused] Everybody was very kind and friendly .
[unused] Especially the team of the main restaurant was really professionell and nice .
[unused] I felt like a princess , sometimes ; · ) !
[unused] Thank you very much everybody !
[unused] I will come back there .
[unused] Business and shopping
[unused] Very warm comfortable friendly hotel .
[unused] Near Milano Centrale train station with bus stop to all airports .
[unused] It takes 20 min. to get to Corso Buenos Aires where you can find very nice shops .
[unused] At the hotel : rooms are not big , but nice and clean ( I was at this hotel several times and saw different rooms ) , clean comfortable bathrooms .
[unused] I prefer stay at this hotel , when they have free rooms .
[unused] Cheap , but miserable
[unused] I requested a non · smoking room , only to find a cigarette in the toilet .
[unused] After calling reception , they offered me an upgrade .
[unused] This however requires walking all around the hotel , and there is only one set of elevators for each floor ( the hotel is a pyramid , and the elevators are only in one corner ) .
[unused] The food was expensive .
[unused] And my salad was a dressing soup topped with some lettuce .
[unused] Location of the hotel and dinner excellent
[unused] · small rooms but a big balcony in rooms with seasight
[unused] · breakfeast ( buffet ) is good , dinner is excellent

[unused] the car park gets a little busy when there is a function on , but all worked out with a bit of cooperation ; the breakfast times are fine during the week but I would have preferred a little later cut off on Sunday · again the staff sorted it to everýone 's satisfaction .
[unused] We had a groundfloor room so access for my scootmobile was no problem and parking of the scootmobile was also sorted without any fuss · a great team , staff and management .
[unused] Very nice hotel !
[unused] The hotel was very nice , I think it 's good that they have like 5 restaurants so the people are spread over 5 restaurants so it 's never so crowded .
[unused] But on the other hand I missed the a la carte restaurants that you have in so many hotels because that 's more pleasant / cosy .
[unused] The hotel is very clean !
[unused] The food was very good , I especially liked the breakfast because there were a lot of different kinds of cheese , and for dinner the Asian restaurant is my favorite .
[unused] There are mainly German people in the hotel ( I think 70 / 80 percent )
[unused] But what I really didn 't like was the music in the lobby bar en all the other bars , way to old !
[unused] I hope that next time thay have an area with modern music
[unused] Le Méridien Munich
[unused] We have stayed in this hotel for 4 nights recently .

[unused] Overall this is a very nice hotel for couples , families and likely even for singles , considering it 's proximity to the beach as well as Rimini 's main thoroughfare .
[unused] The staff is knowledgeable concerning special recommendations for restaurants and otherwise also very forthcoming .
[unused] The rooms with a small kitchen are highly recommended for those who want to save money and enjoy the delicacies that can be found at the weekly market in the old part of Rimini !
[unused] Very good hotel

[unused] marvin from holland

[unused] He was not allowed in the restaurant though , which is also acceptable .
[unused] The staff were very friendly .
[unused] We didn 't stay much in the hotel since we spent most of the days outside .
[unused] There aren 't many English channel on TV unfortunately .
[unused] The location is ok if you are used to walk .

[unused] Relax
[unused] There is no much to say , it is my 7th year I am spending holidays in this hotel .

[unused] Who needs a room ( junior suite ) this large
[unused] The hotel looks , and is most likely , clean inside , which cannot be said from the outside .
[unused] Probably as soon as you are not on the premises anymore , it is not that clean .
[unused] During my walk this morning ; from the hotel to the office ; I got out of the hotel and walked to the escalator which is there and it smelled terrible !
[unused] The hotel features free Wireless Internet which is also pretty fast , which allows you to work and surf without any problems .
[unused] Using Skype may cause connection problems .
[unused] There is a bar in the hotel as well as a restaurant , and also in the immediate surroundings there are places to stay , if you 'd like to .
[unused] Old and very tired hotel
[unused] There are two reasons to choose this hotel : relatively low price comparing to other centrally located hotels and location in walking distance from the main station .
[unused] This hotel is very old and needs renovation long ago .
[unused] Tiny dark rooms with very basic comfort , practically , only beds .
[unused] Cheap bed linen and grey towels .

[unused] The food in general is very very good also the rooms
[unused] Great location , attentive staff
[unused] This hotel has a great location , in the heart of Gran Via , and if you need to go somewhere , it is in front of a subway station .
[unused] The room was good , the service was very attentive · I said I needed to leave early in the morning to catch a flight ( which would make me lose breakfast ) , and the front desk offered me a takeaway basket with some fruits , cookies and juice so I could eat it on the go , all free of charge .
[unused] The only drawback from this hotel is that it is in an old building .
[unused] The design is old , and some might find it needs a restoration , but everything works perfectly .
[unused] Best in town
[unused] A very friendly Hotel in a nice park area with excellent food and wine .
[unused] The rooms are not big , but nicely made .
[unused] The service is excellent and helpful in any case .
[unused] It is located next to the park and a rose garden in a calm area 10 min from the center of Trier

[unused] One of the worst hotels I 've ever seen .
[unused] Lobby was full of flies ( dead and alive ) , it was hot , humid and smelly .
[unused] Elevator is so small that two average persons and one suit case are having troubles to fit .

[unused] Simply Good , the Park behind the Hotel is stunning an charming .
[unused] The People are friendly and the Food is fantastic .

[unused] Service was rather poor , and the reception staff was not very friendly or helpful .
[unused] Our room was right next to the bar / club area .
[unused] We had to go through it to go to sleep , and did not feel very safe at all .
[unused] Also , we could hear the loud disco music till very late in the morning , and nothing could be done about it even after we complained .
