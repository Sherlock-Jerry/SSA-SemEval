The other day I had a presentation to do for a seminar at a large conference in town lots of people , little time to prep and have to set up a computer to a projector , etc .####[]
I took it back for an Asus and same thing blue screen which required me to remove the battery to reset .####[([18], 'NEU')]
Toshiba does not send any one out unless you have paid extra to have the on site repair done .####[]
Oh , boy !####[]
But while this is one big advantage as you may know from the company s recent commercials there are other things to consider before going with Apple .####[]
I love the way the entire suite of software works together .####[([6, 7, 8], 'POS')]
Pairing it with an iPhone is a pure pleasure , talk about painless syncing , used to take me forever , now it 's a snap .####[([13], 'POS')]
I shopped around before buying .####[]
Has met or exceeded my needs for a compact travel device .####[]
I sent it back to Toshiba twice they covered it under the warranty .####[([12], 'POS')]
They sent me a replacement part and without informing me are requiring that I return it within 15 days or contact them and let them know the broken part will be returned later .####[]
In desparation , I called their Customer Service number and was told that my warranty had expired 2 days old and that the priviledge of talking to a technician would cost me have your credit card ready .####[([6, 7, 8], 'NEU'), ([14], 'NEG'), ([25, 26, 27, 28], 'NEG')]
Amazing Quality !####[([1], 'POS')]
It does run a little warm but that is a negligible concern .####[]
what an elegant , wonderful machine .####[]
Do you ever think HP would do that ? NEVER !####[]
We upgraded the memory to four gigabytes in order to take advantage of the performace increase in speed .####[([3], 'NEU'), ([14], 'POS'), ([17], 'POS')]
The Genius at the Apple store advised me that there was nothing about my use of the computer that caused this failure .####[]
The Apple MC371LL/A 24Ghz 154-inch MacBook Pro Notebook is a horrible waste of money .####[]
If you find yourself in the market for a new laptop and have the money do n't exclude looking at the MBPs .####[]
Those things are very important , vital even !####[]
I have now had it for 15 months and love it .####[]
Trying to balance all of my roles leaves very little time for me to do anything , so I want to manage my time I do have to be the most efficient .####[]
It would take up too much time to do reaearch for my papers and I would be up hours-just because the computer was too slow .####[]
i 'm returning mine####[]
It weighed like seven pounds or something like that .####[([1], 'NEU'), ([3, 4], 'NEU')]
With a healthy pessimism , I took the machine home and tried to find a flaw .####[]
And not to mention after using it for a few months or so , the battery will slowly less and less hold a charge until you ca n't leave it unplugged for more than 5 minutes without the thing dying .####[([15], 'NEG')]
It absolutely is more expensive than most PC laptops , but the ease of use , security , and minimal problems that have arisen make it well worth the pricetag .####[([14], 'POS'), ([16], 'POS')]
I wish the volume could be louder and the mouse did n't break after only a month .####[([3], 'NEG'), ([9], 'NEG')]
the only fact i do n't like about apples is they generally use safari and i do n't use safari but after i install Mozzilla firfox i love every single bit about it .####[([13], 'NEG'), ([19], 'NEG'), ([24, 25], 'POS')]
Great battery , speed , display .####[([1], 'POS'), ([3], 'POS'), ([5], 'POS')]
they improved nothing else such as Resolution , appearance , cooling system , graphics card , etc .####[([6], 'NEG'), ([8], 'NEG'), ([10, 11], 'NEG'), ([13, 14], 'NEG')]
now he mows yards so he can earn the money for the wireless internet .####[]
Additional caveat , the base installation comes with some Toshiba-specific software that may or may not be to a user 's liking .####[([4, 5], 'NEG'), ([10], 'NEG')]
High price tag , however .####[([1, 2], 'NEG')]
Buy this .####[]
The processor a AMD Semprom at 21 ghz is a bummer it does not have the power for HD or heavy computing .####[([1], 'NEG'), ([21], 'NEG')]
I love the 15 MacBook Pro .####[]
breaks easily .####[]
They sent out the box right away for me to send in my computer , they paid postage and whatnot , but when I got my computer back it still was n't running right , and now my CD drive was n't reading anything !####[([32], 'NEG'), ([38, 39], 'NEG')]
I bought this laptop Was the worst Laptop I 've ever bought .####[]
Yeah , of course smarty pants fix it nowASPECT1 , Compared to the early 2011 edition I did see inbuilt applications crashing and it prompted me to send the report to Apple which I promptly did .####[([19, 20], 'NEG')]
Summary , Dont buy HP .####[]
I think part of the problem with this computer is Vista , yet I know Vista is n't the entire issue because my latest purchase was my Acer and it also has Vista I should have waited the few months to get the next operating system .####[([10], 'NEG'), ([15], 'NEG'), ([32], 'NEG'), ([44, 45], 'NEU')]
That whole experience was just ridiculous we sent it in and after they told us that we had to pay $ 175 to fix it we were like we will just by a portable mouse which would be way cheaper but they refused to send the laptop back until we paid the $ 175 and it was fixed .####[([34], 'POS')]
-I give up on my data , I just want a computer reasonably fast .####[]
it was shooting sparks !####[]
Tech support tells me the latter problem is a power supply problem and have offered to fix it if it happens again .####[([0, 1], 'POS'), ([9, 10], 'NEG')]
upon giving them the serial number the first thing I was told , was that it was out of warranty and I could pay to have it repaired .####[([19], 'NEU')]
Laptop was in new condition and operational , but for the audio problem when 1st sent for repair .####[([11], 'NEG')]
I was disappointed when I realized that the keyboard does n't light up on this model .####[([8], 'NEG')]
The laptop was very easy to set up .####[([6, 7], 'POS')]
Well , maybe I was just very unlucky .####[]
I loaded windows 7 via Bootcamp and it works flawlessly !####[([2, 3], 'POS'), ([5], 'POS')]
I have never had to shut down the computer unexpectedly and the computer has never froze on me .####[]
I hate the display screen and I have done everything I could do the change it .####[([3, 4], 'NEG')]
this computer will last you at least 7 years , thats an amazing life spanned an electronic .####[([13], 'POS')]
I am very pleased with my purchase !####[]
I ca n't say enough of how satisfied I am with their product and help aftermarket .####[([12, 13, 14, 15], 'POS')]
-Called MacHouse Amsterdam to ask for a temporary replacement , no answer .####[]
I bought it during the recent Comex IT show .####[]
I have had nothing but problems since the day I took it out of the box !####[]
The image is great , and the soud is excelent .####[([1], 'POS'), ([7], 'POS')]
Where you click and hold and drag it picture , link , etc to where you want it .####[]
The macbook rarely requires a hard reboot .####[]
I LOVE it !####[]
Now for the hardware problems .####[([3], 'NEG')]
It was an all around waste of money for me .####[]
also it is light weight compared to others .####[]
Waiting for the i7 was well worth it , great value for the price .####[([3], 'POS'), ([13], 'POS')]
I asked how they would determine that since there are no scratches , dents or other signs of damage and was told that was the only way this type of damage could happen .####[]
The Macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box , all the functions works great .####[([6, 7], 'POS'), ([16], 'POS')]
Reason why ? It 's because when you buy it , you know first thing that you will not lose any value for that laptop , the price will stay the same for the next year , and even if Apple does decides to change mode , your laptop value will only drop 10-20 % , unlike PC laptops which drop more than 80 % .####[([21], 'POS'), ([27], 'POS'), ([49], 'POS')]
So , buyers beware !####[]
Do I like the computer ? Well , other than not getting viruses , I guess it is OK .####[]
Its a dog plain and simple .####[]
My HP is very heavy .####[]
Best Buy was great as always and accepted the return and gave me another model 1764 .####[]
I can actually get work done with this MAC , and not fight with it like my tired old PC laptop .####[]
And I 'm still paying the bloody financing , for a product which did n't last me at least three years !####[]
Games being the main issue .####[([0], 'NEG')]
While the computer seems to be set up in a common sense way rather than in geek-speak , there are certain quirks that can drive you crazy trying to deal with the PC world .####[]
Thank God for ctrl ZBottom line , I 've been using laptops since the mid 90s and probably the majority of brands out there .####[]
Even with virus protection , it always turned off when updates were needed and installed .####[([2, 3], 'NEG'), ([10], 'NEG')]
Even so , I like playing online games , so it was wonderful that there is a feature where I can dualboot Windows .####[([7], 'NEU'), ([17], 'POS'), ([22], 'POS')]
That 's the downside for me .####[]
It has good speed and plenty of hard drive space .####[([3], 'POS'), ([7, 8, 9], 'POS')]
It 's so useable and responsive .####[]
It has come into good use for my finances , scheduling , my parents business expenses , and it is definitely amazing for gaming .####[([5], 'POS'), ([23], 'POS')]
It was weird .####[]
I visited the Apple Store and was impressed with the 17-inch MacBook Pro .####[]
Looking to take my video and photo editing to the next level , I decided to purchase the MBP 15in Intel Core i5 after reading consumer reviews as well as professional reviews of this laptop .####[]
It doesnt work worth a damn .####[([2], 'NEG')]
i will be returning it and switching brands when i get to best buy .####[]
Product support very poor as each phone call costs me long distan####[([0, 1], 'NEG')]
Frustrated I hung up and tried to call back 3 days later to be told that it takes 2-3 days for turnaround time .####[]
May be better for the occasional web surfer .####[]
Not super fancy , but not super expensive either .####[]
The lcd screen stopped working on mine after 10 months .####[([1, 2], 'NEG')]
I 'm going back to PC .####[]
Great , quick laptop for the money .####[]
with the switch being at the top you need to memorize the key combination rather than just flicking a switch .####[([2], 'NEG'), ([19], 'NEG')]
Until I bought the Dell , I thought you just looked for what you wanted size , software , options , hardware and purchase the best deal you could find .####[([15], 'NEU'), ([17], 'NEU'), ([21], 'NEU')]
It is easy to go from one keyboard to another .####[([7], 'NEU')]
Has a 5-6 hour battery life .####[([4, 5], 'NEU')]
First it burned or fused the power adapter plug .####[([6, 7, 8], 'NEG')]
Toshiba is aware of the issue but unless the extended warrenty is bought Toshiba will do nothing about it .####[([9, 10], 'NEG')]
Navigation through the computer is far superior compared to Windows operating systems , as well .####[([0], 'POS'), ([9, 10, 11], 'NEG')]
Once you go Mac , you ca n't go back !####[]
Fan noise , The fan made a constant hissing noise in the background .####[([0], 'NEG'), ([4], 'NEG')]
So needless to day , I 'm not happy .####[]
Plain and simple , itlaptop runs great and loads fast .####[([5], 'POS'), ([8], 'POS')]
of course my warranty runs out next month .####[([3], 'NEU')]
The capabilities using that program alone made me want a Mac .####[([4], 'POS')]
If you ever see the spinning beachball come up when you think it should n't , check the Activity Monitor app to see if the disk throughput has temporarily dropped to zero .####[([5, 6], 'NEG'), ([25, 26], 'NEU')]
I have found also , it is very easy to be able to access wireless internet access ;####[([14, 15, 16], 'POS')]
That was a big mistake .####[]
Small enough to use on a long flight , Light enough to carry through airports and powerful enough to replace my desktop while on long business trips .####[([12], 'POS')]
If you are looking for a netbook pc DO NOT BUY FROM ASUS ! ! !####[]
We have n't had any problems with it at all .####[]
It meets all my needs for work and pleasure while traveling .####[]
He said quite a number of people had encountered this problem and said it is a common issue .####[]
Much of which HP ended up paying for .####[]
The pictures are clear as can be .####[([1], 'POS')]
You have to toss out the wifi card and replace it just to have any sort of network capability .####[([6, 7], 'NEG'), ([17, 18], 'NEG')]
It 's perfect for everything and runs faster than an average pc !####[([6], 'POS')]
Then after paying for it to be examined I was told it was same problem cited on website but I 'd have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty .####[([29], 'NEG')]
It 's so bad that I 'm thinking I only got half a battery or something .####[([13], 'NEG')]
It is just slow slow slow .####[]
I wiped nearly everything off of it , installed OpenOffice and Firefox , and I am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price .####[([9], 'NEU'), ([11], 'NEU'), ([26], 'POS')]
Overall I feel this netbook was poor quality , had poor performance , although it did have great battery life when it did work .####[([7], 'NEG'), ([11], 'NEG'), ([18, 19], 'POS')]
MY ONLY PROBLEM IS I CAN NOT REG THE PRODUCT KEY .####[([9, 10], 'NEG')]
Sure it has the one touch keys but that was the best feature of the computer .####[([4, 5, 6], 'POS')]
I can do pretty much 75 % of what I do on my desktop on my kitchen table .####[]
Love the stability of the Mac software and operating system .####[([2], 'POS'), ([5, 6], 'POS'), ([8, 9], 'POS')]
I left the place angrily .####[]
It is so great , I can Hardly ever take my hands off it !####[]
My real problem with it ? The statement of 7 hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration - it 's a lie .####[([11, 12], 'NEG')]
She said Wal Mart rants and raves abouy carring Dell because it 's a big name but they are a piece of garbage .####[]
I use iphoto all the time , which is a great program for anyone who is into photography , amateurs and experts alike .####[([2], 'POS'), ([11], 'POS')]
I hate it .####[]
I thought the price was great for the specs .####[([3], 'POS'), ([8], 'POS')]
Just for a stupid CD .####[]
This just keeps having it 's hard drive replaced !####[([6, 7], 'NEG')]
I do not experience a lot of heat coming out of it , however I would highly suggest purchasing a stand however , due to the nature of the design of the macbook as it is one very large heat sink .####[([20], 'NEU'), ([29], 'NEG'), ([39, 40], 'NEG')]
There is NO way I will buy a LG product in the future .####[]
Maybe this is virus related , maybe not , but the computer has locked up many times , and on two occasions , the screen has simply gone black .####[([24], 'NEG')]
Using this machine is like a mild form of torture .####[]
Whenever tried to turn it on , it would restart as soon as the BIOS launched Windows or Winblows , as I like ot call it .####[([14], 'NEG'), ([16], 'NEG')]
I run windows via bootcamp for the couple programs I do not want to buy a mac version of , like my cad programs .####[([2], 'NEU'), ([4], 'NEU'), ([8], 'NEU'), ([23], 'NEU')]

It took Toshiba tech support 4 calls and 4 different techs to correct the problem .####[([2, 3, 4], 'NEG'), ([10], 'NEG')]
The 4 USB ports are nice , but the two on the side only work now and then .####[]
It out performs any other laptop on the market today .####[]
This is what I call a good after sales service .####[([7, 8, 9], 'POS')]
It is short on space , and downloads always had problems being completed , or were said to be corrupted ' .####[([4], 'NEG'), ([7], 'NEG')]
Apple is always great about the aesthetics of things , they always come up with good looking products .####[([6], 'POS')]
The MacBook Pro is very sturdy and versatile .####[]
Oh and it has word and stuff but its a trial verion so after about a month or so when you go to open it it asks for a product key which did n't come with the computer and even after clicking cancel it wont let you use it at all I use the old word processer which works good .####[([55, 56], 'POS')]
Oh yea , has no numeric pad on the side .####[([5, 6], 'NEG')]
It would be a load on long trips where a lot of walking is required .####[]
The battery life is amazing , the versitility is outstanding .####[([1, 2], 'POS'), ([7], 'POS')]
the hinge design forced you to place various connections all around the computer , left right and front .####[([1, 2], 'NEG')]
I would definitely not go back to using a PC after using the mac .####[]
The screen graphics and clarity , and sharpness are great .####[([1, 2], 'POS'), ([4], 'POS'), ([7], 'POS')]
Strong performance in this device makes use of fun and a strong sense of the era of speed This device serves all modern requirements is a very strong game and is very use for designers .####[([1], 'POS'), ([6], 'POS'), ([17], 'POS'), ([32], 'POS')]
You will fall in love with it in no time .####[]
Best thing is I can use existing 32 bit old programs .####[([10], 'POS')]
It 's still beautiful and has better color reproduction than I could ever expect from a notebook .####[([7, 8], 'POS')]

The cool thing about the Mac Book was that I went on my honeymoon and shot a bunch of pictures and movies with my iPhone , then I came back and put them onto my Macbook and made a pretty good DVD movie with all the pictures and videos from my trip .####[]
After 4 days , being denied 6 times and told off once , I managed to get through and was able to send them a scanned copy of the receipt .####[]

Asus facial recognition does n't work and windows logon is n't either .####[([1, 2], 'NEG'), ([7, 8], 'NEG')]
So buyer beware when buying Toshiba####[]
The minute you fire it up it 's all good , very easy user interface .####[([13, 14], 'POS')]
I have had two Toshiba satellite computers and while they are okay , they are in no way comparable to the Mac .####[]
I actually contact Toshiba before I started having problem and was given run around after I supplied serial number in order to delay me sending in laptop until after warrenty expired .####[([29], 'NEG')]
After replacing the hard drive the battery stopped working 3 months of use which was frustrating .####[([3, 4], 'NEU'), ([6], 'NEG')]

One drawback I noticed was sound quality via USB .####[([5, 6, 7, 8], 'NEG')]
I am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook , it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop .####[]
I was psyched .####[]
If I have a few hundred dollars to spare , I 'd buy the Pro line though , the 253 and 266 GHz model .####[]
Needs Power and Mouse Cable to Plug in back instead of side , In the way of operating a mouse in small area .####[([3, 4], 'NEG'), ([19], 'NEG')]
It seems to be incompatible with everything else .####[]

We are addicted to the Mac .####[]
Maybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden .####[]
everything about a mac is wonderful , it takes a little used to learning and getting used to the new system , but you will learn fast and its all worth it .####[([20], 'NEU')]
I also bought one for my wife , and 3 for my office .####[]
The only thing I can imagine is that Sony jumped on early specifications for Vista requirements from Microsoft and designed it to those inadequate requirements .####[([14], 'NEG')]
The mouse is a little bit different than what you 're used to though it has one big flat panel and one full bar instead of two separate ones to click with but you get used to it quite quickly .####[]
It took several weeks just to get them to acknowledge that I owned the warranty .####[([14], 'NEG')]
It was a huge monstrosity of a Laptop !####[]
-I propose that they can just swap the hard drives .####[([8, 9], 'NEU')]
So having the AC plug go out on me and get lose or I could actually here it inside my computer on two of the three times is not good .####[([3, 4], 'NEG')]
The computer is currently in West Verginia doe to the method of shipping choosen by Toshiba .####[([12], 'NEG')]
I can see why the have soooo much money .####[]
Iphoto is great for adding pictures right to facebook and other social networking sites .####[([0], 'POS')]
In early May I got it back and this time I only had it back for 1 day before it had a NEW issue so it was sent back in for the 6th time they expedited the repairs so I was only supposed to have to be without it for 3 days and it was supposed to be fixed , by a Senior Tech .####[([62, 63], 'NEG')]
I would never buy a Dell again .####[]
For me , keys were starting to get stuck and would n't type very well .####[([3], 'NEG')]
This is still a fairly good upgrade to a laptop that was about 4 years old .####[]
The computer was shipped to their repair depot on june 24 and returned on July 2 seems like a short turn around time except the computer was not repaired when it was returned .####[([6, 7], 'NEU')]
My friends are in awe every time they come over !####[]
I work in film editing and post production , so I need a laptop that not only has power , but memory and speed as well .####[([18], 'NEU'), ([21], 'NEU'), ([23], 'NEU')]
At first when I got this product , I loved it .####[]
THIS is what a laptop is supposed to be .####[]
Then I 've fixed the DC jack inside the unit , rewired the DC jack to the OUTside of the laptop , replaced the power brick .####[([5, 6], 'NEU'), ([13, 14], 'NEU'), ([24, 25], 'NEU')]
It is easy to use , has great screen quality , and every so light weight .####[([4], 'POS'), ([8, 9], 'POS')]
I 've been having endless problems since I bought the computer , only 1 month ago####[]
I wanted to spend around $ 700 to $ 800 so I was directed to a nice looking HP Laptop .####[]
I 've had my Macbook Pro since August 2009 .####[]
Unfortunately , the laptop I purchased was also a Dell and again , I have to say i hated it .####[]
This is the first time that I tried and owning a netbook although I have used 3 different laptops in the past 10 years , I find not much difference except of course for the screen size .####[([35, 36], 'NEU')]
Everything about the Mac is not only visually appealing , but very easy to use .####[([14], 'POS')]
But if you ca n't make your product last more than a year , you will not get my business again .####[]
Seems like maybe a bad shipment from Toshiba .####[([5], 'NEG')]
Currently if I use the laptop I ca n't sit it on my lap because it will burn my legs .####[]
I can leave my MacBook uncharged for upwards of eight hours and it wo n't even be dead .####[]
I do find that my MacBook has a lot more bells and whistles than a normal PC especially if you enjoy technology , downloading pictures and graphic design .####[]
First the screen goes completely out .####[([2], 'NEG')]
I 'm learning the finger options for the mousepad that allow for quicker browsing of web pages .####[([8], 'POS'), ([13], 'POS')]
We researched and found the best price at MacConnection .####[([6], 'POS')]
I droped this once from thetable when my baby girl grabed me one day and IT is still working with NO issues !####[]
returned it .####[]
It is a cheap throw together .####[]
It easily fits into most computer bags but does n't weigh down a backpack or satchel when being carried with spirals and/or textbooks .####[]
I actually had the hard drive replaced twice , the mother board once , the dvd drive twice , then they FINALLY agreed to replace it , ALL OF THIS IN LESS THAN 1 1/2 YEARS !####[([4, 5], 'NEG'), ([10, 11], 'NEG'), ([15, 16], 'NEG')]
The guy then said that if I insist on having the hinge tightened , they can do it for me but I have to accept the condition after the repair .####[([11], 'NEU')]
I 've been a PC user and I just finally switched and I am never going back .####[]
Will certainly use MacConnection again .####[]
So you might ask , what did Apple do for me ?####[]
The ease of set up was terrific .####[([3, 4], 'POS')]
This was around three years , maybe four years ago .####[]
Please , anyone who is considering getting this computer , stop .####[]
I had my computer custom built from Sonystylecom .####[]
This computer is really fast and I 'm shocked as to how easy it is to get used to .####[]
From the get-go , the M6809 was unsteady in its operation ;####[([10], 'NEG')]
One of the wonderful things about Macs is that they are virus free .####[]
After 5 months of failed repairs , requested a full refund but was refused and it still is not repaired and Acer is indifferent to the issue .####[]
You better believe my next computer will be a MAC !####[]
With all the programs that came with it , such as iLife and iWork , I was set from the very beginning .####[([3], 'NEU'), ([11], 'NEU'), ([13], 'NEU')]
Best Buy laughed when I told them they should replace it instead of expecting me to be without a computer again for another couple of weeks .####[]
There are no gold key numbers too intall programs , you must use the serial numbers that it does not accept and then things are limited as far a working because they are only good for a short time .####[([8], 'NEG')]
If you want a little more custom ability , drop a few bucks and upgrade to one of the more robust versions of Win 7 and grab a 2GB stick of memory to spice it all up a bit more .####[([23, 24], 'POS'), ([28, 29, 30, 31], 'POS')]
Speakers too small to be of any real use .####[([0], 'NEG')]

The battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months , stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes .####[([1], 'NEG'), ([5], 'NEG'), ([18], 'NEG')]
See when it comes to laptops you buy it and get just a normal operating system with trials of must need stuff that should come with it .####[([14, 15], 'NEU')]
At first it 's like you 're in that honeymoon stage with your laptop .####[]
I especially like the backlit keyboard .####[([4, 5], 'POS')]
Besides the great look , it is a great machine .####[([3], 'POS')]
Took it back as it was defective .####[]
This system is not worth the money or trouble trying to get it fix .####[]
I purchased it this year when my old HP laptop finally died and I was looking for something smaller and lighter than a laptop to carry around for classes and traveling .####[]
I bought this eMachines Notebook PC in January of this year and I am highly dissatisfied with it .####[]
Even though the computer is larger they did not make the keyboard larger .####[([11], 'NEG')]
It is VERY easy to type on and feels great , besides the added feature that the keyboard is lighted .####[([5], 'POS'), ([14], 'POS'), ([17], 'POS')]
The feel of this machine compared to the old MacBook is far superior .####[([1], 'POS')]
Thank you .####[]
I saved for this laptop for 3 months and I can tell you personally it was worth the wait .####[]

Sure , the initial out of pocket expense is greater , but that should not dissuade anyone from the fact that these machines run like none other on the planet , and when I factor in all the money in that I wasted on Geek Squad and the latest patches to de-corrupt my infested PCs , it probably comes out about even anyhow .####[([7], 'NEG'), ([23], 'POS')]
I am glad I did my research .####[]

In November my computer messed up entirely and would n't power on after intalling a Windows update , I had to have my HD flashed and lost EVERYTHING on it , including my school assignments and irriplaceable pictures that were only in digital format and several other things , when this update was installed for some reason I was unable to roll back the drivers and everything to an earlier working condition because when the update was installed it deleted my history .####[([15, 16], 'NEU'), ([23], 'NEG'), ([64], 'NEG')]
