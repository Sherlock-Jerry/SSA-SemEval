Our friends have not arrived yet .####[]
They came out over cooked and the cheese was almost non existant .####[([7], 'NEG')]

The svc can be a bit rude at times , esp if you have big group , but overall the restaurant is a must !####[([1], 'NEG')]

Never once did I leave feeling unwelcome or impressed .####[]
The food is good , especially their more basic dishes , and the drinks are delicious .####[([1], 'POS'), ([9], 'POS'), ([13], 'POS')]
But the main hit was the whole grilled fish .####[([6, 7, 8], 'POS')]
I had the tuna tartare with sake , mushroom ravioli with pinot noir , and the chocolate sampler with a dessert wine for $ 49 .####[([3, 4], 'POS'), ([6], 'POS'), ([8, 9], 'POS'), ([11, 12], 'POS'), ([16, 17], 'POS'), ([20, 21], 'POS')]

In an area sadly lacking in decent Thai food , this is one of the best spots .####[([7, 8], 'POS')]
Tell them Herky sent you and get a free confused look from the waiter .####[([13], 'NEG')]
Make reservations but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to Time Square .####[([1], 'NEG'), ([11, 12], 'NEG'), ([16], 'NEG'), ([22], 'NEU')]
The food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes .####[([1], 'POS'), ([10], 'POS')]

Your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem !####[]
Also a little more expensive than your average bagel place .####[([8], 'NEU')]
the food was undercooked-the sauce watery , and the vegetables raw .####[([1], 'NEG'), ([4], 'NEG'), ([9], 'NEG')]
And the fried clams had just enough kick to them to make em worth eating .####[([2, 3], 'POS')]
The sauces used are also not that exciting .####[([1], 'NEG')]
The secret is the lunch menu which offers a complimentary appetizer with every entree ordered .####[([4, 5], 'POS'), ([10], 'POS'), ([13], 'POS')]
I absolutely love this place ! ! !####[]
The rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard .####[([1], 'NEG'), ([4], 'NEG'), ([7], 'NEG')]
I am surprised to say the least and find such practice not worth the effort .####[]
When my dessert came , there was a candle in it , not because anyone asked for one , but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift , and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort .####[([2], 'NEU'), ([22], 'POS')]
I got the $ 10 10-piece dim sum combo , every bite of which was great .####[([6, 7, 8], 'POS')]
There are other Vietnamese restaurants in the chinatown area and you can forget about those .####[]
There is also very limited seating and there can be a substantial wait in getting food at peak times .####[([5], 'NEG'), ([12], 'NEG'), ([15], 'NEU')]

So much more than the usual bar food , go there to enjoy the menu while sampling one of their hand-crafted beers .####[([6, 7], 'POS'), ([14], 'POS'), ([20, 21], 'POS')]
And its absolutely DELICIOUS .####[]
No free drink .####[([2], 'NEU')]

If you want to save some money , do n't go here .####[]
My friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better .####[([4, 5], 'POS')]

Having not been home in the last 2 years may skew this reviewer a bit , but the food was tasty and spicy sans the oil that comes floating along at similar venues .####[([18], 'POS'), ([25], 'NEU')]
The portions are now very small , the sauces are overly-ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good , the restaurant , due to its popularity , seems frantic .####[([1], 'NEG'), ([8], 'NEG'), ([15], 'POS')]

I brought some buddies from CA and they loved it .####[]
Inside is a little cramped , but to be expected .####[]

A must for all the Dosa lovers .####[([5], 'POS')]
The portions are HUGE , so it might be good to order three things to split rather than one appetizer and entree per person for two people .####[([1], 'POS'), ([19], 'NEU'), ([21], 'NEU')]
The appetizers are just OK and the main courses were decidedly subpar .####[([1], 'NEU'), ([7, 8], 'NEG')]

The exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations .####[([1, 2], 'POS')]

This is definitely a place that provides the best experience , though , to both A-listers and people walking in off the street .####[]
They were such a rip-off $ 895 for four small meat patties in steamed buns and not worth trying .####[([10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'NEG')]
