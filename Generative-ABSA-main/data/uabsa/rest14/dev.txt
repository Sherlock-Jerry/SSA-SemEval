If the omakase is to showcase technique and variety , serving almost 40 % of items BBQ-ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not-so-fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance .####[([10], 'NEU'), ([19, 20, 21], 'NEG'), ([25], 'NEG')]
The staff has always been friendly without seeming grating , and the chef has greeted us on a couple of occasions .####[([1], 'POS'), ([12], 'POS')]
The only possible drawback to this last point is that as of the date of this posting , the additional menu items are only written in Chinese .####[([20, 21], 'NEG')]

They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice .####[([13], 'NEG'), ([21], 'NEU')]
The dosas are skimpy , unattractive and drip with grease , and personally I 'd drink popcorn topping before I 'd eat another one of these .####[([1], 'NEG'), ([16, 17], 'NEU')]
