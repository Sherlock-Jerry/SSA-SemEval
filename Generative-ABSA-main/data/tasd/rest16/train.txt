This is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it 's a matter of taste that she didn 't like it , and I cannot comp it .####[('manager', 'service general', 'negative')]
Again , no apology , no is there anything else I can get you , no can I get you a drink to make up for it , nothing ! ! ! !####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
The level of rudeness was preposterous .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want , so we paid for what we did enjoy , the drinks and appetizers , and walked out .####[('manager', 'service general', 'negative'), ('drinks', 'drinks quality', 'positive'), ('appetizers', 'food quality', 'positive')]

If I could give 0 stars I would do so for this place .####[('place', 'restaurant general', 'negative')]
The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews .####[('NULL', 'restaurant miscellaneous', 'negative')]
Well . . .they can run but they can 't hide .####[('NULL', 'restaurant general', 'negative')]
This place . . .god where do i begin .####[('place', 'restaurant general', 'negative')]
It is quite a spectacular scene i 'll give them that .####[('scene', 'ambience general', 'positive')]
The decor however seems to be the distraction so you won 't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME ! ! ! !####[('decor', 'ambience general', 'neutral'), ('eggplant', 'food quality', 'negative'), ('eggplant', 'food prices', 'negative'), ('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]

Great Hot Dogs !####[('Hot Dogs', 'food quality', 'positive')]
Though it 's been crowded most times I 've gone here , Bark always delivers on their food .####[('food', 'food quality', 'positive'), ('Bark', 'restaurant miscellaneous', 'neutral')]
The hot dogs are top notch , and they 're Slamwich is amazing !####[('hot dogs', 'food quality', 'positive'), ('Slamwich', 'food quality', 'positive')]
Going to Bark is always worth the train ride , and will make your tongue and belly very happy !####[('Bark', 'restaurant general', 'positive'), ('NULL', 'food quality', 'positive')]
Only complaint is the pricing--I believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu .####[('menu', 'food prices', 'negative')]
But nonetheless--great spot , great food .####[('spot', 'restaurant general', 'positive'), ('food', 'food quality', 'positive')]
Fabulous food - if the front of house staff don 't put you off – ####[('food', 'food quality', 'positive'), ('front of house staff', 'service general', 'negative')]
It 's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions , but we 've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years . ####[('NULL', 'restaurant prices', 'negative')]
Each time we 've been , the front of house staff  (not the waiters - they 're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you ) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return . ####[('waiters', 'service general', 'positive'), ('front of house staff', 'service general', 'negative'), ('fish dishes', 'food quality', 'positive')]
As BFC doesn 't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated , which can be over an hour later !####[('BFC', 'restaurant miscellaneous', 'negative'), ('front of house staff', 'service general', 'negative'), ('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
The frizzy retro girl  (with winged / Dame Edna glasses ) will yell at you if you try to order a drink . ####[('girl', 'service general', 'negative')]
I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she  "had a BBQ to go to " that night - WTF ? ?####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
I 'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely !####[('staff', 'service general', 'negative')]
There 's another girl who I can 't describe , she is about 5 '6 " with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're  *really * talking about . ####[('girl', 'service general', 'negative')]
I 'm a friendly person , so I wouldn 't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal . ####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
Again , I 'd be super upset if that were my employee .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
Considering you will spend at least  $60 a head , I expect better service . ####[('service', 'service general', 'negative'), ('NULL', 'restaurant prices', 'negative')]
So , if you 're walking by and thinking about dining , you might want to see who 's going to be seating you first . . .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
Maitre-D- "Eat and get out "####[('Maitre-D', 'service general', 'negative')]
The food and service were fine , however the maitre-D was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant .####[('food', 'food quality', 'positive'), ('service', 'service general', 'positive'), ('maitre-D', 'service general', 'negative')]
While finishing our meals which included a high-end bottle of wine , our son 's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert .####[('bottle of wine', 'drinks quality', 'positive')]
This guy refused to seat her and she left , followed shortly by the four of us , but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel , including Paris , that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant .####[('frontman', 'service general', 'negative')]
His response was smug , arrogant , and condescending , totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
A word to the wise : you can 't dine here and disturb the maitre-D 's sense of  " table turnover " , as whacked as it is , or else .####[('maitre-D', 'service general', 'negative')]
If you go here , do it on his off-night .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]

Taking Hot Dogs to the next level####[('Hot Dogs', 'food quality', 'positive')]
At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint , but at Bark you don 't just get your average hot dog .####[('Bark', 'restaurant prices', 'negative'), ('hot dog', 'food quality', 'positive')]
Here the hot dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available .####[('hot dog', 'food quality', 'positive'), ('hot dog', 'food style_options', 'positive')]
Great Atmosphere####[('Atmosphere', 'ambience general', 'positive')]
I highly recommend the fish tacos , everything else was ok .####[('fish tacos', 'food quality', 'positive'), ('NULL', 'food quality', 'neutral')]

When the main course finally arrived  (another 45mins ) half of our order was missing .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
Never got an explanation as to what was going on .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
The manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly .####[('manager', 'service general', 'negative')]

Can’t believe how an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients .####[('restaurant', 'restaurant prices', 'negative'), ('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
What a hassle !####[('NULL', 'restaurant general', 'negative')]
The food is very good , but not outstanding .####[('food', 'food quality', 'neutral')]
There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives , the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table .####[('staff', 'service general', 'negative'), ('NULL', 'food quality', 'negative'), ('wait', 'service general', 'negative')]
On our last visit , they skipped over our name on the list , leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
Mistakes happen , but they are usually accompanied by an apology , perhaps even a glass of wine . . .but not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La staff .####[('staff', 'service general', 'negative')]

I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said ,  "can I help you " and  "how many are in your party . "####[('waitress', 'service general', 'negative')]
The three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
We didn 't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately I think that may have been part of the problem .####[('NULL', 'restaurant miscellaneous', 'negative')]

The waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand .####[('waiter', 'service general', 'negative')]
I can 't believe that it was , but please put the bag down before delivering food !####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating  (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so I try to ignore it ) .####[('waitress', 'service general', 'negative')]
I couldn 't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends , who was in mid bite , to clear the table .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
She then put the check down without asking if we were done , and came to check on the bill every two minutes , even though we were one of three occupied tables .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
