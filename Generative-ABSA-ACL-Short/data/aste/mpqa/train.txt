None Despite the logistical hurdle of moving at least several dozen presumably dangerous men around 8,000 miles from Afghanistan , Rumsfeld called Cuba ` `the least worst place . ''####[]
None U.S. Rep.

None Planners scrambled to deploy healthcare workers and Muslim clergymen before the White House abandoned that idea .####[]
None In this instance , military sources said , the number of prisoners would be much smaller -- perhaps in the dozens -- and the logistics would focus more on security at the 45 - square - mile base and less on the comfort of prisoners who are considered either members of a terrorist network or supporters of terrorists .####[([44, 46], [47, 48], [0], 'Negative', 'Weak')]

None There is also a gate between Cuba proper and the base that is sometimes opened for meetings between military commanders , or to repatriate Cubans who have been taken to the base .####[]
None Cuban leader Fidel Castro has long argued that the U.S. military occupation of the base is illegal , while U.S. officials say the base exists under a lease agreement that was part of a 1934 treaty with Cuba .####[]

None Prescott came to Anderson 's support on Friday , agreeing that financial figures quoted by Kyoto opponents in Canada about the potential damage to the Canadian economy were " pure fiction . "####[([3, 5], [2, 7], [0, 2], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None A study by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters Association said the accord would cost the Canadian economy up to C$ 40 billion by 2010 , but a Dutch report released earlier this week said it would only be C$ 727 million .####[]

None The situation in which Putin has agreed to open former Soviet military airfields to American armed forces in three ( former Soviet ) Central Asian countries could be regarded as dramatic .####[]

None One cannot underestimate the significance of the fact that Russia has opened its airspace .####[]
None True , Putin only permitted ( Americans ) to deliver via Russian airspace aid to the " theater of the anti-terrorism military operations , " ( i.e. not soldiers and weapons ) .####[]
None Nevertheless , this amounts to such high degree of Russian - American cooperation in a wartime situation , the two sides have never attained during the past 10 years .####[]

None He wanted to become an ally , and that 's what he has become .####[([3, 7], [1, 3], [1], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None But making this complex decision was not easy for him .####[]
None Reformers told Putin all along that he should take advantage of " the rare opportunity for ( Russia ) to become integrated with the civilized world . "####[]
None But main stream Russian military policy has been to keep a distance from America , the country that has been historically responsible for " educating " the Taliban that had caused the demise of Soviet occupation forces in Afghanistan .####[([13, 15], [5, 7], [3, 5], 'Neutral', 'Weak')]
None In the end , a certain consideration that differed from the above two proved to be decisive .####[]
None It had to do with Chechnya .####[]
None Putin has no greater desire than to present to the West the Chechen independence movement as a chapter of " international terror . "####[([7, 24], [2, 6], [1, 2], 'Positive', 'Strong'), ([12, 17], [7, 9], [1, 2], 'Neutral', 'Weak')]

None At this time however , he taught a lesson to the Americans .####[]
None After the Americans had promised everything good and nice , Putin remarked almost as an aside that the events in Chechnia " could be interpreted only in the context of the struggle against international terrorism . "####[]
None In reality , Putin asked for a free hand regarding Chechnia , some understanding , or even that the Americans look the other way .####[([7, 25], [5, 6], [4], 'Positive', 'Weak'), ([0], [13, 16], [4], 'Positive', 'Average')]

None Nevertheless , one could not fail taking note of the fact that in the same response the United States called upon the Chechens to " unconditionally and without delay to terminate every contact with international terrorist groups , " and that they accept Putin 's offer to make peace .####[([22, 50], [19, 22], [17, 19], 'Positive', 'Strong'), ([47, 50], [46, 47], [17, 19], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None If we view this warning against the background that Putin 's government has always seen Usama Bin Ladin 's hands behind " Chechen terrorism , " we were witnessing a late recognition of Moscow 's views .####[([0], [4, 5], [27, 28], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None The Russian President has understood this American recognition .####[]
None In Berlin , where he was the center of stormy celebration , he vindicated for himself the deeper truth that may be seen behind terror .####[([5, 6], [9, 13], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong'), ([13], [13, 17], [13], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None He argued that had the West not continued to keep alive during the past several years the Cold War stereotype of a threat from the East , but would have concentrated instead on terrorism , the common enemy , the twin towers of New York may not have collapsed .####[([33, 35], [1, 3], [1], 'Neutral', 'Average'), ([5, 7], [1, 3], [1], 'Neutral', 'Average')]

None Pedro Malan 's attitude in relation to Argentina is very different from that of Jaime Caruana , governor of the Bank of Spain , the Spanish central bank .####[]
None To Caruana , Argentina has to " create a broad program that generates internal and external stability and discuss it with the IMF . "####[]
None The Bank of Spain Governor did not want to detail what points Argentina should deal with to expand its program .####[([9, 21], [6, 9], [1, 6], 'Negative', 'Weak')]
None Spain is one of the leading investors in Argentina , whose instability had a big impact on the results of Spanish banks in 2001 .####[]
None But Caruana said that the banks " did their homework " and made provisions for their investments in Argentina .####[]
None Malan noted that as part of the constructive engagement in relation to Argentina , a group of experts spent the day with authorities from that country , recounting their experiences in situations like the one the Argentines are facing .####[]
None In the group were former Bank of Mexico Governor Miguel Mancera , who dealt with the peso crisis in 1995 ; a former Chilean Central Bank president who faced the 1982 crisis , when the Chilean GDP dropped by 14 percent ; former IMF Fiscal Affairs Director Vito Tanzi ; an expert in restructuring the Spanish debt ; and former Brazilian Central Bank President Gustavo Loyola , who lived through the time of the Collor government 's withholdings and of the Proer [ Program to Encourage the Reorganization and Strengthening of the National Financial System ] - the program to restructure the Brazilian banking system .####[]
None In Argentina 's defense , Malan says that Brazil 's Mercosur partner " has sought to define with clarity the fundamental issues of its basic regimes - foreign exchange ( floating exchange rate regime ) , monetary ( they intend , after phase of transition , to define their inflation goal system , which was important to Spain from 1995 - 1998 ) and fiscal . "####[]
None This , the Minister insists , is why " it makes no sense to demand that everything be done in one or two weeks , " referring to what the IMF and some governments , like that of the United States , are asking .####[([14, 26], [4, 7], [3, 4], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([16, 26], [43, 45], [30, 42], 'Neutral', 'Weak'), ([16, 26], [14, 16], [3, 4], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None Malan defends a single currency for Mercosur .####[([3, 8], [1, 3], [1], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None " We want to keep alight the flame of a single currency in the region in future , even if a distant one , " but until then , " there is the job of consolidating the institutions in the political and institutional sphere , of productive restructuring and of modernizing the State " in six countries - Brazil , Argentina , Uruguay , Paraguay , Chile and Bolivia .####[([4, 25], [3, 4], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None The Minister says he is radically opposed to the idea of dollarizing the Brazilian economy .####[([9, 16], [5, 8], [1, 3], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None " We do not want to yield on Brazil 's having its own currency , its regional currency .####[([6, 15], [3, 6], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None Dollarization is a not very trivial process of negotiation with the country that issues the currency , in this case the dollar , involving complex questions about the role of ultimate lender , the role of the Federal Reserve in the supervision and regulation of the banks in the dollarized country . "####[]
None According to Malan , the dollarization process is irreversible .####[]
None The Minister believes that tension between Brazil and Argentina , resulting from the floating of the real in 1999 , will tend to disappear because the neighboring country is opting for a floating exchange rate system .####[([32, 37], [29, 31], [1, 2], 'Neutral', 'Weak'), ([8, 10], [4, 6], [1, 2], 'Negative', 'Weak'), ([6, 8], [4, 6], [1, 2], 'Negative', 'Weak')]
None Malan predicts that Argentina will be more competitive when it emerges from the crisis .####[]
None " A little calm is needed , the ability to look ahead , not let oneself be carried by the difficulties of the moment , " he emphasizes .####[]
None According to the Minister , Mercosur managed , after an " enormous technical effort , ' something that did not exist in the region two years ago - the harmonization of the statistics of the member countries , Bolivia and Chile , which were not comparable before .####[]
None " Today we have comparable statistics ; there is a macroeconomic monitoring group in the Finance Ministry and experts from the six countries ' central banks who meet regularly .####[]
None Based on this effort of statistical harmonization , we announced , in December 2000 , an agreement for basic convergence parameters .####[]
None The presidents of the six countries endorsed certain goals in relation to the debt , GDP , nominal deficits as a proportion of the six countries ' GDPs , and maximum inflation .####[([7, 33], [6, 7], [0], 'Positive', 'Weak')]
None Whoever says that these are small steps is incapable of recognizing the European Union 's experience , " the Minister says .####[]
None According to Malan , " long marches start with first steps . "####[]
None This was an important step that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso called a little Maastricht , that is , the search for convergence parameters that serve as a reference point for talks between experts from the six countries , the Minister says .####[]
None To Malan , however , more important than the harmonization of the parameters and the little Maastricht is the search for convergence of policies in a broader sense - structural , macro and microeconomic ones .####[]
None The Finance Minister says he hopes , for Mercosur , something similar to what happened in the EU : " an ability to look decades ahead and not let oneself get beaten down , like in some countries that dedicate themselves to lamenting , that see the difficulties as being insurmountable , and the problems as being unsolvable .

None Malan defends a different posture : " to set aside the notion of cynicism , skepticism , that things will not work out , " and believe , like the Europeans , that there is a future to be built by the Mercosur countries and Chile and Bolivia , the associate members .####[([3, 53], [1, 3], [1], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([0], [3, 7], [1], 'Neutral', 'Weak')]

None HARARE - Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe predicted victory Saturday as he cast his ballots in presidential and local elections at a primary school in Harare 's working - class suburb of Highfield .####[]
None Asked if he would accept the results of the hotly contested election , Mugabe said : " I will accept it , more than accept it because I will have won . "####[([0], [10, 11], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None The 78 - year- old former guerrilla leader , who has governed since independence in 1980 , took another swipe at the former colonial power Britain and other western nations , which he said have prejudged the vote .####[([37, 39], [35, 37], [33, 34], 'Negative', 'Weak'), ([22, 31], [18, 21], [33, 34], 'Negative', 'Average')]

None Mugabe has faced widespread criticism and sanctions from the European Union and the United States over alleged rights violations and manipulation of the election process .####[([0, 2], [4, 6], [9, 16], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None Tinkering has left voting procedures so confusing in Harare that even Mugabe and his top aides appeared unsure of where the president was to vote .####[]
None Mugabe was clearly expected to turn up at Mhofu School in Highfield , where state television had a truck posted and had been broadcasting live since polls opened early Saturday .####[]
None Several of Mugabe 's ministers and senior aides were also on hand to see their leader cast his ballot , as well as a throng of reporters and camera operators .####[]
None But it turned out the president would perform his civic duty instead at Kudzanai School , also in Highfield .####[]
None Mugabe had to vote at that particular ward in order to be able to cast ballots both for president and for mayor in Harare , which is holding the two elections simultaneously .####[]
None The opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) complained that the set- up was deliberately confusing in a ploy to discourage the urban vote , which is thought to favor Mugabe 's challenger Morgan Tsvangirai .####[([31, 37], [31], [0], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([12, 15], [9, 11], [1, 9], 'Negative', 'Average')]

None Salmah Trading and Investment Company said its fishermen , who were captured last August while fishing in the Fangak area in south Sudan 's Upper Nile region , were set free Tuesday by the Sudan People 's Liberation Army ( SPLA ) .####[]
None " The release was due to tremendous efforts by the citizens who benefit from the company 's services , " the company said in a statement received by AFP , without elaborating further .####[]

None Erbamont will then be liquidated , with any remaining Erbamont holders receiving a distribution of $ 37 a share .####[]

None He was responding to a question from Gulf Times whether there would be demonstrations during the WTO ministerial meeting , which opened in Doha yesterday .####[([0], [13, 14], [8, 9], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None Parmentier , however , did not say categorically that there would be street demonstrations .####[([0], [11, 15], [0, 2], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None But , he added that the Qatari government had neither sought nor was given any commitment by Greenpeace not to undertake demonstrations .####[([0], [21, 23], [3], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None We discussed a number of conditions for the boat to be allowed to moor here and we have fulfilled all those conditions , the environmentalist told reporters on board the ship at the Doha harbour , before setting sail towards Doha Sheraton , the conference venue .####[]
None So , we will act very responsibly and I have given all guarantees to Sheikh ( Hamad bin Faisal ) al - Thani ( chairman of the organising committee ) that we would be responsible , peaceful and that we would act in a very constructive manner with them .####[]

None He pointed out that Qatar , while presenting Dohas candidature to host the meeting , had made an official commitment that it would allow peaceful protests .####[([0], [24, 27], [1], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None Earlier , the Rainbow Warrior sailed into Doha on Thursday morning , to challenge the WTO to use the 4th ministerial conference to force the United States to commit to the Kyoto Protocol on climate change .####[([25, 37], [23, 25], [3, 5], 'Neutral', 'Strong'), ([25, 28], [13, 15], [3, 5], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None Talking to the press , Greenpeace executive director Gerd Leipold said currently the most important issue is climate change .####[]
None If we continue to burn fossil fuel at the rate we are going today , we look at a bleak future .####[]
None Islands will go under , nations will vanish from the face of earth and millions of people will have to leave their homes .####[]
None The environmental organisation warned the delegates at the conference that the principles of the WTO would be rendered worthless unless the meeting extracted the commitment from the US on Kyoto Protocol .####[([11, 32], [3, 5], [1, 3], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None The US produces 25 % of world green house gases but has only 4 % of the population of the world .####[]
None It just cannot be that one country reaps all the benefits of mock globalisation but does not take any responsibility for the biggest global problem we are facing today .####[]
None This is fundamentally unfair and unjust , Leipold said .####[]

None The Kyoto Protocol rejection by the US is in effect a hidden subsidy .####[([1, 3], [3, 5], [0], 'Negative', 'Weak')]
None This is a breach of the very constitution of WTO .####[]
None The WTO claims that it wants to protect the environment .####[([7, 11], [6, 7], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None Then today , in Doha , they must condemn the US for allowing a hidden subsidy , which according to the US governments own figures is equivalent to between $ 76.7 bn and $ 300 bn by 2010 .####[([10, 12], [8, 10], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None This is the first test case for WTO .####[]
None Parmentier urged the delegates not to even discuss the possibility of a new round of trade negotiations unless the US this week in Doha ratifies the Kyoto Protocol .####[([3, 29], [2, 3], [0, 1], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None He said Greenpeace looked forward to work in partnership with developing countries to get the proper assessment of the impact of the WTO instead of a new round of trade negotiations .####[([7, 32], [3, 6], [1, 2], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None In 1993 , when the WTO was created everybody jumped without checking whether there was a proper safety net at the bottom .####[]
None What we are saying is , lets not jump again too quickly and lets check if there is a safety net .####[]
None And lets consolidate those safety nets before we jump into a new round .####[]
None This is the only responsible course of action and it will be a historic success for Doha and we want this meeting to be a success .####[([21, 27], [20, 21], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None If in six days time there has been no new round , this meeting will have been a success , because it will force the WTO to change , he said .####[]
None WTO decisions must not be allowed to overrule international environmental agreements ; the precautionary principle must be incorporated in decision-making , and patents on life must be banned , Parmentier added .####[]
None On board the Rainbow Warrior are nationalities from 18 countries , including witnesses from local communities who will testify to the adverse effects of WTO global policies .####[([25, 28], [18, 20], [12, 17], 'Neutral', 'Weak')]

None At the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change held recently in Morocco , Japan laid artificial obstacles to the session by seeking its own profit .####[]
None In discussing the draft regulations to put the " Kyoto Protocol " into force , Japan openly took issue with the draft regulations only because the contents of the regulations were not in its favor .####[]
None It grudgingly agreed to it only when some countries made concessions and made amendments to the draft .####[([5, 6], [1, 4], [1], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None Japan calculated that it would suffer a tremendous loss , if the draft regulations were ever passed intact and would be adopted as a legal document .####[]
None The session of the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change held this time was to reach on an actual agreement regarding regulatory problems that have to be solved to put the " Kyoto Protocol " adopted in 1997 into force , so that the world may reduce the greenhouse effect and ecological damage , which are becoming more serious with each passing day , protect human lives and health , and provide favorable conditions for the promotion of human civilization .####[]
None As is feared by the whole world , preservation of the environment is becoming an awfully grave and pressing problem that is linked to the existence of mankind .####[([8, 29], [2, 5], [5, 8], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None How the problems of the global warming and environmental preservation are handled today will have a major impact on the lives and health of people as well as the future development of the world .####[]
None This is the reason why many people of the world today are demanding that the world take concrete measures for protecting the environment , as they have come to realize its importance .####[([15, 25], [12, 14], [6, 12], 'Neutral', 'Strong')]
None However , as was revealed this time , Japan , which was in a position to take the lead to solve the environmental problems , attempted to back away from solving the problems .####[]
None It is a well -known fact that the " Kyoto Protocol " was adopted at the Fifth Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change held in Japan in 1997 .####[]
None According the " Kyoto Protocol , " developed countries are supposed to set goals to reduce greenhouse gases emission and officially put the " Kyoto Protocol " into force by the year 2002 .####[]
None For the " Kyoto Protocol " to enter into force , 55 countries have to ratify it .####[]
None At the 1997 conference , representatives of many countries of the world supported and welcomed the adoption of the " Kyoto Protocol " as an epoch-making measure to curb the warming of the earth 's surface and atmosphere .####[([16, 24], [12, 16], [5, 12], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None It was expected that the protocol would be ratified by the countries that signed it and would have a legal binding force .####[]
None Emphasizing the significance of the adoption of the " Kyoto Protocol , " Japan loudly trumpeted at that time that the adoption of the protocol was " produced by the role " Japan had played .####[([14], [14, 17], [14], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None Japan even called for working out practical measures to have it enter into force .####[([4, 15], [2, 4], [1, 2], 'Positive', 'Weak')]
None Nonetheless , Japan , changing its stand this time , opposed the draft regulations to put the " Kyoto Protocol " into force and even called for liquidation of the draft .####[([30, 32], [25, 27], [3, 4], 'Neutral', 'Weak'), ([27, 32], [25, 27], [3, 4], 'Neutral', 'Weak'), ([12, 24], [10, 12], [3, 4], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None This shows how capricious Japan is and how frequently it changes its stand when the stakes matter the most .####[]
None Of course , behind the Japan 's behavior lies its stakes .####[]
None According to the " Kyoto Protocol , " by 2008 - 2012 Japan is supposed to reduce its greenhouse gas emission by six percent from the 1990 level .####[]
None If Japan is to achieve this goal , it will have to put a lot of effort .####[]
None It has to restructure the plants and enterprises , introduce new technology , and upgrade production lines .####[]
None To do all these things , it needs a tremendous amount of money for investment .####[]
None Never doing anything unprofitable is the nature of Japan .####[]
None Accordingly , Japan would never readily agree on putting the " Kyoto Protocol " into force .####[]
None In the course of calculating the gains and losses of the " Kyoto Protocol " and trying to figure out what it should do , Japan found a good excuse .####[]
None The United States , which has to do the most to implement the " Kyoto Protocol , " has come out opposing the draft regulations .####[([23, 26], [20, 23], [1, 4], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None On the pretext of the US opposition , Japan was attempting to realize its own objective .####[([0], [6, 8], [5, 6], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None In the midst of this situation , a Japanese official visited the United States and received the instruction that Japan should avoid inordinate behavior with respect to the issue of implementing the " Kyoto Protocol . "####[]
None That was a hint that it would not be good for Japan to play a leading role in dealing with a matter detrimental to US interests .####[]
None Since Japan has no spirit of independence and has always acted on US directions , Japan had continued to put off####[]
None Diet ratification of the protocol and took such an attitude at the UN session held this time , under the plausible pretext that it would be meaningless to put the " Kyoto Protocol " into force , if the United States were excluded .####[]
None What Japan is doing with respect to the issue of putting the " Kyoto Protocol " into force is tantamount to an act of betrayal against mankind in the effort to protect human lives , health , and the earth 's atmosphere .####[]
None At present , the global warming is a most serious issue , whose gravity is second only to that of a nuclear war .####[]
None Here , Japan and other developed countries have to assume especially large responsibilities .####[]
None Nonetheless , Japan is backing away from resolving the issue , although it is in a position to play a leading role .####[]
None Japan should be condemned by the world for that .####[([1], [3, 6], [6, 8], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None Japan will be unable to escape stronger denunciation and more serious isolation from the world , if it continues to seek only its own profit and create stumbling blocks , and does not do what it is supposed to do to prevent the global warming and seek environmental preservation .####[([22, 26], [18, 22], [18], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([1, 2], [7, 9], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]

None Speaking on behalf of the NGOs , human rights organisation , Hakam president Ramdas Tikamdas said the boycott was to protest the government 's poor response to Suhakam 's numerous recommendations thus far .####[([22, 34], [20, 22], [13, 16], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None " The NGOs note with deep concern that the government has largely ignored Suhakam 's maiden report and its freedom of assembly report .####[([9, 24], [4, 8], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong'), ([13, 24], [11, 13], [0], 'Neutral', 'Weak')]

None Ramdas said the government 's failure to adhere to the commission 's recommendations creates the impression that Suhakam is nothing but " a mere public relations tool " .####[]
None " Over the last two years , the state of human rights in Malaysia has deteriorated with increasing numbers of people detained without trial under the Internal Security Act , with blanket police ban on assemblies , with restrictions to the right of free speech and expression and with further restrictive amendments to the election laws , all of which have further denied our democratic space , " he added .####[]
None The NGOs also noted that the government has yet to show its commitment and respect for universal human rights principles by ratifying the international instruments of human rights , namely the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and the Covenant Against Torture .####[([16, 21], [12, 16], [1, 3], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None Controversial appointments####[]

None " The fact that three commissioners have now been axed is a clear signal to other commissioners that their tenure is dependent on whether or not they have pleased the executive .####[([0], [28, 30], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None " This clearly undermines the independence of the Commission and will erode public 's confidence on it . "####[([18, 19], [14, 16], [0], 'Positive', 'Weak')]
None On the other hand , the NGOs said there is nothing in the public records which shows that Abu Talib was committed to protecting civil liberties and advancing human rights .####[([29, 31], [27, 28], [6, 8], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None Claiming that there was " nothing personal " , the NGOs said their concern was based on his defense of the 1987 ' Ops Lalang ' where more than 100 people were detained under the ISA [ Internal Security Act ] .####[([18, 42], [13, 15], [10, 12], 'Negative', 'Average'), ([21, 26], [18, 20], [10, 12], 'Neutral', 'Weak')]
None They added that Abu Talib , during his tenure as AG [ attorney general ] , was also instrumental for the impeachment of then Lord President Salleh Abas and five Supreme Court judges in 1988 .####[]
None The NGOs also expressed concern over the appointment of five new commissioners which has led to Suhakam being made up mostly of retired civil servants .####[([7, 26], [3, 6], [1, 3], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None The new commissioners are retired Treasury deputy secretary - general Ramon Navaratnam , permanent representative to the United Nations Hasmy Agam , Institute of Islamic Understanding Malaysia ( Ikim ) director-general Dr Abdul Monir Yaacob , retired Education director-general Asiah Abu Samah and retired National Population and Family Development Board director-general Dr Raj Abdul Karim .####[]

None Elaborating further on the boycott , Ramdas said the NGOs will not hold any dialogues , send any memorandums or complaints to Suhakam .####[]
None " In the meantime , we will monitor the commissioners in the discharge of their statutory duties in respect of the pending complaints and inquires , " he said .####[([0], [22, 24], [28, 29], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None " We will also note to what extent Suhakam will monitor the government 's compliance with previous recommendations on various human rights issues contained in its maiden report to the Parliament as well as its other reports , " he added .####[]
None Ramdas said Suhakam 's performance will be judged not on the number of statements issued or reports produced but on the improvement of human rights in Malaysia .####[]

None Instead of resorting to such measures , the commissioner said the NGOs should work with Suhakam for the advancement of human rights in this country .####[]
None He added the boycott could create the impression that the NGOs were acting out of self interest and are not honest about championing human rights .####[([24, 26], [22, 23], [1], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None " This action shows that the NGOs themselves do not acknowledge Suhakam and do not want to work with us , " said Hamdan .####[([21, 22], [14, 19], [23, 25], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None I would say between the ages of 7 to 10 years old it , was a really big thing to go to the movie on Saturday mornings .####[]
None And one particular movie theater we went to , they would show serials every Saturday , which were a continued story .####[]
None So if you missed one Saturday you would miss what happened in a particular episode and you , um , would n't know what had taken place .####[]
None So we would go every Saturday morning .####[]
None And also at this theater , they gave prizes to different people .####[]
None And one of the way they gave prizes was , they would take big group photos and everybody , and there were stairs going up to a balcony , real wide stairs .####[]
None And the big group of people would go stand on the stairs and there would be probably 30 or 40 kids in the picture .####[]
None And they 'd take the picture and then you would go back the next Saturday after they had been developed and they would have circled 3 or 4 people in the picture and the people whose head was circled would get the prizes .####[]
None Is that for real ?####[]
None That 's for real !####[]
None That really happened !####[]
None And one time I can remember , I think it was Steve , my brother , um , he , and they would give treats like candy , I do n't even remember what all kinds of prizes the would give .####[]
None But for some reason , and I think this is really true , he got ice cream sandwiches !####[]
None Like a box of ice cream sandwiches .####[]
None And of course there 's nothing to do with a box of ice cream sandwiches when you 're at a 2 - hour movie !####[]
None They 're going to melt !####[]
None And another , um , that was in , that was in High Point , NC .####[]
None And then we moved to Charlotte and we used to go to � and I do n't think its even still there I do n't know if the building is or not � but the Dilworth Theatre .####[]
None I lived in the Dilworth area , and we would go to the Dilworth Theatre and I do remember that it cost 9 cents to get a ticket to get in .####[]
None And we would , could go to the movie .####[]
None We would get maybe 15 cents each to go to the movie , and I sound like I 'm 95 years old -####[]
None - with those kinds of prices .####[]
None Um , but we would go to the movie and then you would go in and get your , your snack that you wanted .####[]
None And there were several different choices .####[]
None I do n't ever remember getting popcorn at the movie until I was a teenager or in my adult life .####[]
None But we would , uh , buy , lollipops is what they call them now , but we called them suckers and we would get often a 2 - cent sucker .####[]
None Are you making fun ?####[]
None No , I love this story .####[([5, 7], [4, 5], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None And the 2 - cent suckers is what is referred to now as a Tootsie Roll Pop .####[]
None And we called them 2 - cent suckers because every other sucker cost a penny .####[]
None Except these were 2 cents because they had the Tootsie Roll in the middle .####[]
None And there was one other sucker that cost a nickel and we called that an all day sucker , just because you could n't eat the whole thing for the entire movie and you would really just have that sucker all day long .####[]
None And one other form of refreshment that we got , which really embarrassed my mother because she did n't know anything about this until she went with us to the movie one Saturday , there was a bakery next door to the movie theatre .####[([11], [11, 14], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None And my brothers and myself were not the only people that did this ; all the kids that would go to the movie knew to do this .####[]
None We would go into the bakery and we would ask for -####[([0], [10, 12], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None - a nickel worth of scraps !####[]
None And we did n't even have to ask for it because the bakery lady knew us and she knew to have all this ready for all the kids going to the movie .####[]
None And what it was it was broken cookies and broken pieces of whatever happened while they were baking , mistakes .####[]
None So they would fill little bags for us and we would give them a nickel and we could take that to the movie theatre with us .####[]
None And that 's all the stories I can remember about the movies right now .####[]
None I do know that I did used to go the movie downtown at the Carolina Theatre .####[]
None And when I was young , it was n't a strange thing for the kids to just go off and go to a movie .####[]
None I mean , my mother knew where we were going and she knew when we would get back , but today you would n't send your seven or eight year old child to a movie theatre alone even if they were with their nine year old brother ; you just would n't do it .####[]
None And we could skate to the movie or ride a bicycle to the movie and we would do that .####[]
None Which is kind of sad that you ca n't do that anymore and it 's not just because things are , there 're bad people in the world but it 's too much traffic .####[]
None You have to check everything about a movie , check it out to see what the content is and just was n't like that when I was growing up .####[]
None Also about that same time period in my life , I guess again between seven and ten years old , which seems to be what I remember most vividly , my best friend uh , was Kathy Josey , and she was a next door neighbor also , and we remained friends up until , uh , she was about 35 and she passed away with cancer .####[]
None But we , we remained close friends .####[]
None In fact we shared an apartment , first apartment either one of us ever had .####[]
None And when we were , um , little girls we used to play " Career Girls " !####[]
None We did !####[]
None And we used to try to dress up and pretend we were businesswomen .####[]
None And we would go to work and pretend we had an apartment together and then when we grew up , we sure did ; we got an apartment .####[]
None Uh- huh .####[]
None Um , Kathy and I also used to play other kind of dress ups and it just , it seems like , I remember we both had like our mother 's long skirts , or the skirts would be long on us and we would literally wear dress up clothes that belonged to our mothers .####[]
None But we had , Kathy had one pair of pearls or beads of some sort of necklace that was her mother 's and I did n't have the necklace .####[]
None And it was really beautiful and I really , really wanted one .####[([0, 1], [7, 12], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None So we only had the one necklace and we , er , we decided , I do n't know if it was jointly or if Kathy was just extremely nice of whatever , but she said I could wear it part of the time .####[]
None And we would literally time the amount of time , we wore it like 30 minutes or 15 minutes or whatever .####[]
None And the way we decided who got to wear it first , and this always kind of bothered me because I know Kathy did this intentionally , she said the youngest one got to wear it first and she was like six months younger than I am .####[([14], [14, 19], [0], 'Negative', 'Weak')]
None So , it , that became a normal thing with us .####[]
None Whenever we only had one of something she would always say , " Well , I think the youngest one gets to do it , or wear it or whatever first . "####[]
None And , that just always stuck in my mind , that in , in our adult life I brought that up to her and she sort of acted like she did n't know anything about that and I thought to myself , " she does , " and then she laughed about it and she realized that she had kinda held a trump card on that one .####[]
None Um , also we did a lot of pretending and as I said we played career girls and the dress ups .####[]
None And my sister and I used to pretend also and Jill is about 2 years younger than I am , maybe two and a half , and we used to play Robin Hood except we did n't have a Maid Marion , we had a Saretha , I do n't know where in the world that name came from .####[]
None But we would switch playing Robin Hood , one would play Robin Hood and one would play Saretha .####[]
None And Saretha was the counter , would be the same thing as Maid Marion , and , why , again , I do n't know why we did n't use Maid Marion .####[]
None But in my mind I can remember playing that , like all day long .####[]
None And we would go over to my grandparents ' and they had a a big white house with a big front porch and , uh , banisters on it and a lot of rocking chairs out on the front porch .####[]
None And it was just a great place to pretend and we would climb up on the porch and on the banisters and we could make those our horses or , uh , it could be a castle ; just do many things with it .####[]
None Um , and when we were still living in High Point in our back yard we had a huge , I do n't know , I guess it was an oak tree , but it was a really big tree , but it was a climbable tree .####[]
None And it had real large , thick branches extending out to the side and they were fat enough branches where as a child of eight and nine years old we could straddle the branches .####[]
None And that was another game that Jill and I used to play ; we would pretend we were in the jungle and we would climb up on the tree and we would straddle the tree branches and pretend it was our elephant .####[]
None And in the yard , we had an old tree that had been cut down and just the stump was remaining and my mother had planted , um , flowers all around that stump and we would use that stump as a , as a throne and the princess got to sit up on that stump on that throne and have all those flowers around her and that would be the throne and she would be the queen or the princess or whatever .####[]
None When I was a teenager , an Audrey Hepburn movie came out called Wait Until Dark .####[]
None And I think I was probably 16 or 17 years old ; we were of driving age .####[]
None And I had a group of girlfriends that I ran around with and there were , golly , there might 've been 8 to 10 of us who were good friends .####[]
None Everybody had their own " best " friend but then we had one big group that we used to do a lot of things together .####[]
None Um , and we would , had that many girls but we would only go out in a couple of cars and I remember one of the girls , Betty Belle , her dad had a VW Beetle , and we 'd fit like 5 girls in that VW Beetle .####[]
None Did Betty Belle turn Catholic ?####[]
None No , huh-uh .####[]
None She didn't ?####[]
None No .####[]
None So we went out one night to the movie , but before we went to the movie we went to get pizza and then we went to , and I think the name of the place was The Open Kitchen , and we did n't have chain pizza places like we do now , like Pizza Hut and all that .####[]
None This was just a really neat pizza place that all the kids would go .####[]
None And we went to Open Kitchen and we would have eight or 10 girls and we would order one pizza and all share it and everyone would only get one piece and I think we would make the waitresses mad because we did n't have money to leave tips .####[([35], [37, 40], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None We would also drink water .####[]
None So it was n't a good situation for the waitresses , but we had fun and we did n't even think about it .####[([0], [14, 16], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None We just did what we could get away with .####[]
None Anyway , that night we were gonna go see Wait Until Dark and I think it was on at the Manor Theatre , and I just remember when you have like 10 or so girls going somewhere to the same place it 's kind of a , pretty much of a spectacle ; we 're all in this long line and we 're giggling and laughing and cutting up and having really a great time .####[]
None So we bought our tickets and we went into the Manor Theatre and we found a row of seats and we sat , file , all filed in .####[]
None And I just remember seeing , and I was sitting in a middle section , I was not on an end so I had girls I knew on both sides of me .####[]
None And I just remember that movie was , had a lot of hype about being really scary and suspenseful and it 's nothing like these movies that are out today like Scream and , what is it ?####[]
None Nightmare on Elm Street whatever it is , where they 're actual horror movies .####[]
None This was , uh , a real intense , um , drama and , just very scary ; kept you on the edge of your seat .####[]
None And there was a scene in the movie I remember where every one of us , and it was n't just our group , but so many people in the theatre , they screamed out at one time .####[]
None And that 's really all I remember about that night , it was just a lot of fun .####[]
None And I really hope that my daughters have had some nights like that and has had good times like that , that I can remember going out with good friends .####[]
None .START####[]
None The government is sharpening its newest weapon against white -collar defendants : the power to prevent them from paying their legal bills .####[]
None And defense lawyers are warning that they wo n't stick around if they do n't get paid .####[]
None The issue has come to a boil in Newark , N.J. , where federal prosecutors have warned lawyers for Eddie Antar that if the founder and former chairman of Crazy Eddie Inc. is indicted , the government may move to seize the money that Mr. Antar is using to pay legal fees .####[]
None The warning by the U.S. attorney 's office follows two decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court last June .####[]
None In those cases , the high court ruled that federal law gives prosecutors broad authority to seize assets of people accused of racketeering and drug-related crimes , including fees paid to lawyers before an indictment .####[]
None If the government succeeds in seizing Mr. Antar 's assets , he could be left without top-flight legal representation , because his attorneys are likely to quit , according to individuals familiar with the case .####[]
None A seizure also would make the case the largest -- and one of the first -- in which lawyers ' fees have been confiscated in a prosecution unrelated to drugs .####[]
None " The people who suffer in the short run are defendants , but the people who suffer in the long run are all of the people , because there wo n't be a vigorous private bar to defend the Bill of Rights , " says Gerald Lefcourt , a criminal defense attorney who says he has turned down a number of cases to avoid possible fee seizures .####[]
None Mr. Antar is being investigated by a federal grand jury in Newark , where prosecutors have told him that they may soon seek an indictment on racketeering and securities fraud charges .####[]
None Under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law , or RICO , the government has the authority to seek to freeze or seize a defendant 's assets before trial .####[]
None According to individuals familiar with Mr. Antar 's case , prosecutors issued their warning this week after one of Mr. Antar 's attorneys asked whether legal fees might be subject to seizure .####[]
None In a letter , prosecutors told Mr. Antar 's lawyers that because of the recent Supreme Court rulings , they could expect that any fees collected from Mr. Antar may be seized .####[]
None Prosecutors have told Mr. Antar 's attorneys that they believe Mr. Antar 's allegedly ill-gotten gains are so great that any money he has used to pay attorneys derives from illegal activities .####[]
None Therefore , they said , the money can be taken from the lawyers even after they are paid .####[]
None Justin Feldman and Jack Arseneault , attorneys for Mr. Antar , both declined to comment on the matter .####[]
None In Newark , U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito said , " I do n't think there 's any legal reason to limit forfeiture of attorney 's fees to drug cases . "####[]
None Mr. Alito said his office " just responded to an attorney 's question about whether we would go after attorney 's fees , and that is different from actually doing it , although we reserve that right . "####[]
None Mr. Antar was charged last month in a civil suit filed in federal court in Newark by the Securities and Exchange Commission .####[]
None In that suit , the SEC accused Mr. Antar of engaging in a " massive financial fraud " to overstate the earnings of Crazy Eddie , Edison , N.J. , over a three - year period .####[]
None Through his lawyers , Mr. Antar has denied allegations in the SEC suit and in civil suits previously filed by shareholders against Mr. Antar and others .####[]
None The SEC has alleged that Mr. Antar aimed to pump up the company 's stock price through false financial statements in order to sell his stake and reap huge profits .####[]
None Mr. Antar , the SEC said , made more than $ 60 million from the sale of his shares between 1985 and 1987 .####[]
None The Justice Department has emphasized that the government 's fee-forfeiture power is to be used sparingly .####[]
None According to department policy , prosecutors must make a strong showing that lawyers ' fees came from assets tainted by illegal profits before any attempts at seizure are made .####[]
None Still , criminal defense lawyers worry that defendants are being deprived of their Sixth Amendment right to counsel and a fair trial if the government can seize lawyers ' fees .####[]
None They also worry that if the government applies asset-forfeiture laws broadly , the best defense lawyers will be unwilling to take criminal cases unless they are assured of being paid .####[]
None It was only natural for US National Security Adviser condoleezza Rice to make statements yesterday after what can be described as a oneupmanship of rudeness was inaugurated in Washington last week .####[]
None The legislative branch took part in this oneupmanship by issuing resolutions showing full allegiance to the radical right wing in Israel .####[([16, 22], [9, 15], [1, 4], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None The US legislative branch even outbade the Israeli right wing .####[]
None If Rabbi Kahana were alive , he would have been regarded as a moderate person , compared to the US legislative branch .####[]
None Even the most radical Israeli hardliners expressed the idea of the transfer more politely than the most senior , elected US bodies , which called on the Palestinians to give up the West Bank and look for what they called another homeland .####[([27, 29], [39, 40], [39], 'Neutral', 'Weak'), ([27, 43], [24, 27], [39], 'Positive', 'Weak'), ([27, 29], [24, 27], [39], 'Positive', 'Weak')]
None The Congress ' resolutions and the statements made by leaders and members of the Congress revealed the US Administration 's harbored intentions .####[]
None Rice 's statements came to dot the i's and cross the t's .####[]
None They served as a crude example of the arrogance of power and attempts to control nations ' resources , dictate policies , and impose leaders through pressure and coercion .####[]
None The flagrant attack , which Condoleezza Rice launched on the Palestinian leadership yesterday , demonstrates how international dictatorship is practiced by the most powerful country on earth , which claims to be democratic and an advocate of nations ' right to choose their leaders .####[([10, 12], [2, 4], [5, 7], 'Negative', 'Strong')]

None Back on the Earth , they will report about the results they have obtained since August 13 .####[]
None The primary objective of the shuttle 's mission to the ISS was to deliver the 4th ISS crew and research equipment .####[]
None According to the Mission Control , the shuttle 's crew has perfectly accomplished its mission .####[]
None On its way home , the shuttle launched into space the Starshine micro-satellite , which had been designed by students .####[]
None According to the Mission Control , the satellite which is no larger than a volley ball , has been made by thousands of students who were polishing small pieces of glass subsequently putting them on its surface .####[]
None It slightly resembles of these rotating glass balls which are usually used in disco clubs .####[]
None It is believed that the glass will make it possible to see the satellite at night .####[]

None Text of report in English by Sudanese news agency Suna####[]
None Khartoum , 23 October : The US deputy assistant secretary of state for African affairs [ Charles Schneider ] is due to arrive in Khartoum on Thursday [ 25 October ] at the head of a delegation on a three - day visit to Sudan .####[]
None Director of America Department at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ambassador Mirghani Muhammad Salih said in a statement to Suna [ Sudanese news agency ] that the delegation 's visit comes in preparation for the coming visit of the American envoy for peace in Sudan .####[]
None Ambassador Salih added that the American delegation will meet a number of Sudanese officials and personalities .####[]
None Meanwhile , the Sudanese charge d'affaires to Washington , Ambassador Al - Khidr Harun , told Suna that the American delegation will meet with Sudanese political forces to identify viewpoints on the peace issue .####[]

None Why Kyoto is a rip-off####[]
None According to a study released last week by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters , implementation of the 1997 Kyoto global warming treaty would cost our economy 450,000 jobs and as much as $ 40 - billion .####[]
None But Jean Chretien is not worried .####[([0], [4, 7], [2, 4], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None " I do n't accept these figures , " the Prime Minister said .####[]
None " There is nothing to be gained by frightening people when all the facts are not known . "####[([0], [8, 9], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None But the $ 40 - billion figure , far from being conceived to " frighten " Canadians , is plucked straight from government documents .####[([3, 8], [14, 16], [16, 19], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None According to a report released in 2000 by the National Air Issues Co-ordinating Committee on Climate Change , a group staffed by officials from the federal , provincial and territorial governments , hitting Canada 's Kyoto target may mean " the loss of roughly one year 's growth , or , viewed in absolute terms , in 2010 , the loss in annual economic output of approximately $ 40 - billion ( or $ 1,100 per capita ) . "####[]
None This is not a price worth paying .####[]
None Governments are expected to protect the national economy , and they should deviate from that mission only when crucial national interests are at stake ( fighting terrorism , for example ) .####[]
None Yet rising temperatures pose little threat to Canada .####[]
None In its authoritative Feb. , 2001 , report on the projected impacts of global warming , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change identified several threats to Canadian ecosystems , but concluded that our farmers would generally benefit from warmer temperatures .####[]
None ( Non-farming Canadians , most of whom spend at least part of the winter months scraping ice off their cars , chopping firewood and shovelling their walks , will profit as well . )####[]
None As for the globally felt benefits that would follow from Canada 's implementation of the Kyoto protocol , they are slight .####[]
None By 2010 , our $ 40 - billion sacrifice would yield an expected reduction in annual carbon and carbon - equivalent emissions of about 46 - million tonnes -- just 1/200th of the world 's total projected greenhouse gas output .####[]
None Even if Canada managed to convince the United States and every other Kyoto signatory to ratify the protocol , world carbon dioxide emissions would still soar .####[]
None According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration , world energy consumption will increase by about 60 % between now and 2020 , with most of the upsurge expected to come from developing nations , which are not covered by the Kyoto Protocol .####[]
None Under the fully implemented treaty , carbon dioxide emissions would grow 26 % during the 1990 - 2010 period .####[]
None Without Kyoto , the figure would be 34 % .####[]
None The worldwide cost of that 8 % dip : about $ 2 - trillion in lost GDP -- give or take a trillion .####[]
None There are better ways to spend that money .####[]
None Instead of trying to cap carbon dioxide emissions -- a costly burden at home and an impossible task in the developing world -- we should focus on abating the damage global warming does in at-risk nations .####[]
None If scientists are correct , higher temperatures and rising sea levels will depress grain yields in Africa and parts of Asia , fuel the spread of diseases , and threaten coastal nations such as Bangladesh and Senegal .####[]
None But these problems can be abated , or even eliminated , with Western assistance .####[]
None While helping Third World nations plant new crops , vaccinate people and relocate coastal towns will be costly , the bottom line will likely be only a fraction of Kyoto 's 13 - digit price tag .####[]

None SOFIA , Sept 26 ( AFP ) - A Bulgarian businessman claimed Wednesday that aides to Osama bin Laden approached him in April to try to purchase spent nuclear fuel from a Bulgarian plant and that he met with the Saudi dissident .####[]
None The businessman , who identified himself as Ivan Ivanov and has worked in India , Pakistan , Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates , told AFP that a group of Pakistani nationals introduced him to bin Laden , the prime suspect in the US terrorist attacks , on April 10 in Peshawar .####[]
None A young Arab chemical engineer contacted him the next day , he said , to ask him to act as an intermediary in the sale of the nuclear fuel from the Kozlodui nuclear power plant .####[([17, 36], [15, 17], [1, 5], 'Positive', 'Weak')]
None The businessman said he turned down an offer of a 200,000 dollar commission for the sale .####[]
None The head of the nuclear energy department at Bulgaria 's energy agency separately said he could not imagine a terrorist organisation making a bomb out of products from the reactors at the Kozlodui power station .####[]
None " There is no possibility of legally selling the nuclear waste .####[]
None They are stockpiled in a secure depot located inside the power station before being sent to Russia to be processed , " said Anton Ivanov .####[]
None Researchers from the Weizmann Institute in Rehovot and the Technion in Haifa have developed a computer so tiny that a trillion of them could fit into a laboratory test tube .####[]
None The " computers " are biological molecules , using DNA for software and enzymes for hardware , and can solve a billion mathematical problems a second .####[]
None Such tiny devices could one day fit into cells and supervise biological processes , or even synthesize drugs .####[]
None DNA strands exist in almost every body cell -- they are biological software that tell each cell and molecule what to do .####[]
None " If you look at the mechanism of a cell , a lot of what goes on inside is computation .####[]
None We do n't need to teach the cell new tricks , we just need to put the existing tricks in the right order , " says Prof .####[]
None Ehud Shapiro of the Weizmann Institute , who headed the research .####[]
None Some scientists believe DNA - based computers could have an advantage over existing computers based on silicon chips .####[]
None Artificial chips have reached their limits and ca n't get any smaller .####[]
None But , say the scientists , tiny DNA strands can store huge amounts of information in minuscule space -- one cubic centimeter of DNA can store more information than a trillion CDs .####[]
None Prof .####[]
None Shapiro says the molecular computer is the first of its kind .####[]
None Although computers with DNA input and output have been made before , they have always involved a laborious series of reactions , each requiring human supervision .####[]
None " Previous biological computers were the same size as the room in which the supervisors and computer equipment worked , " said Shapiro .####[]
None " With the new method , all you need do to get an answer is put all the ingredients into a test tube , mix them together , and check to see what the output is . "####[]
None For now biological computers only know how to answer simple questions with a " yes " or " no " response .####[]
None A typical question would be :####[]
None In the sequence " AAB " is there an equal number of As and Bs ?####[]
None Nevertheless , several researchers worldwide have hailed the computers as an important new development .####[([8, 10], [6, 8], [2, 6], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None " They work better than anything I 've seen so far , " said Eric Baum , a computer scientist at the NEC Research Institute in Princeton , New Jersey .####[]
None Although he questions whether biomolecular computers will ever become really useful , he believes they are a " step in the right direction . "####[([15, 16], [13, 15], [13], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None Professor Shapiro and a growing number of other scientists believe DNA - based computers may lead to a number of useful applications -- they could be planted inside cells , where they would watch for irregularities or even synthesize drugs .####[]
None The computer simulates the cell 's natural mechanisms with an accuracy level of 99.8 percent .####[]
None Natural DNA processes also involve inaccuracies which are corrected by other genes , says Shapiro , and it is almost impossible to reach absolute accuracy using biological systems .####[]
None However , for the uses for which the computers are designated , this level of accuracy is adequate .####[]
None So how does such a computer work ?####[]
None Let 's say the computer wants to know whether the number of times a " B " DNA type appears in a DNA section is odd or even .####[]
None The DNA section -- the " input " -- is inserted into a chemical solution along with enzymes to be used as the computer 's " hardware " .####[]
None Other DNA sections are added , which act as " software " .####[]
None A software section sticks to the input with the help of an enzyme .####[]
None If the tip of the input is " B " , the input will be labeled as having an odd number of " B " sequences .####[]
None Another enzyme then cuts the section and reveals the next sequence .####[]
None Each time " B " appears , the label on the input changes from " even " to " odd " and back again .####[]
None Once the computer has dissected the entire input , it can determine whether the sequence appeared an even or odd number of times according to the last label -- the " output " .####[]
None The computer can also do other calculations , such as checking whether the " B " sequence appears at least once , or at most once , by inserting different types of software DNAs .####[]

None At this ceremony , Seyed Mohammad Jalali Parvin , the managing director and a member of the board of directors of the Islamic Republic of Iran's Law Enforcement Forces ' Cooperatives Foundation , presented some awards to the superior companies which had taken part at the exhibition .####[]
None Touching on the importance of modern technology in preventing and reducing crimes in society , Parvin also thanked the active participation of local and foreign companies at Iran 's First International Police and Security Equipment exhibition .####[([23, 27], [17, 19], [15, 17], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None He also assessed the achievements of the exhibition as very useful and satisfactory , hoping that the police and security forces would be equipped with the latest and most modern technology so that they can expedite their activities in their campaign against crimes .####[([17, 44], [14, 16], [1, 2], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([4, 9], [2, 4], [1, 2], 'Neutral', 'Weak')]

None Unisys Corp. 's announcement Friday of a $ 648.2 million loss for the third quarter showed that the company is moving even faster than expected to take write - offs on its various problems and prepare for a turnaround next year .####[]
None At the same time , the sheer size of the loss , coupled with a slowing of orders , made some securities analysts wonder just how strong that turnaround will be at the computer maker and defense-electronics concern .####[]
None " Unisys is getting clobbered .####[]
None Just clobbered , " said Ulric Weil , an analyst at Weil & Associates who had once been high on the company .####[([21, 23], [16, 20], [6, 16], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None " The quarter was terrible , and the future looks anything but encouraging . "####[]
None Unisys , whose revenue inched up 3.7 % in the quarter to $ 2.35 billion from $ 2.27 billion in the year - earlier quarter , had an operating loss of about $ 30 million .####[]
None On top of that , the Blue Bell , Pa. , concern took a $ 230 million charge related to the layoffs of 8,000 employees .####[]
None That is at the high end of the range of 7,000 to 8,000 employees that Unisys said a month ago would be laid off .####[]
None Unisys said that should help it save $ 500 million a year in costs , again at the high end of the previously reported range of $ 400 million to $ 500 million .####[]
None The company also took a write- off of $ 150 million to cover losses on some fixed - price defense contracts , as some new managers took a hard look at the prospects for that slow- growing business .####[]
None In addition , Unisys set up an unspecified reserve -- apparently $ 60 million to $ 70 million -- to cover the minimum amount it will have to pay the government because of its involvement in the defense - procurement scandal .####[]
None Unisys also noted that it paid $ 78.8 million in taxes during the quarter , even though tax payments normally would be minimal in a quarter that produced such a big loss .####[]
None The tax payments will leave Unisys with $ 225 million in loss carry - forwards that will cut tax payments in future quarters .####[]
None In addition , Unisys said it reduced computer inventories a further $ 100 million during the quarter , leaving it within $ 100 million of its goal of a reduction of $ 500 million by the end of the year .####[]
None Still , Unisys said its European business was weak during the quarter , a worrisome sign given that the company has relied on solid results overseas to overcome weakness in the U.S. over the past several quarters .####[]
None The company also reported slower growth in another important business : systems that use the Unix operating system .####[]
None That would be a huge problem if it were to continue , because Unisys is betting its business on the assumption that customers want to move away from using operating systems that run on only one manufacturer 's equipment and toward systems -- mainly Unix -- that work on almost anyone 's machines .####[]
None In addition , Unisys must deal with its increasingly oppressive debt load .####[]
None Debt has risen to around $ 4 billion , or about 50 % of total capitalization .####[]
None That means####[]
None Unisys must pay about $ 100 million in interest every quarter , on top of $ 27 million in dividends on preferred stock .####[]
None Jim Unruh , Unisys 's president , said he is approaching next year with caution .####[]
None He said the strength of the world - wide economy is suspect , and does n't see much revenue growth in the cards .####[([3, 11], [2, 3], [1, 2], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None He also said that the price wars flaring up in parts of the computer industry will continue through next year .####[]
None He said the move toward standard operating systems means customers are n't locked into buying from their traditional computer supplier and can force prices down .####[]
None That , he said , is why Unisys is overhauling its whole business :####[]
None It needs to prepare for a world in which profit margins will be lower than computer companies have been used to .####[]
None " We 've approached this not as a response to a temporary condition in the industry but as a fundamental change the industry is going through , " Mr. Unruh said .####[]
None " The information - systems industry is still going to be a high- growth business , and we 're confident that we have tremendous assets as a company .####[]
None But we do n't minimize the challenges of the near term . "####[]
None Securities analysts were even more cautious , having been burned repeatedly on Unisys this year .####[]
None Some had predicted earnings of more than $ 4 a share for this year , up from last year 's fully diluted $ 3.27 a share on earnings of $ 680.6 million .####[]
None But the company said Friday that it had losses of $ 673.3 million through the first nine months , compared with earnings a year earlier of $ 382.2 million , or $ 2.22 a share fully diluted , as revenue inched up 1.4 % to $ 7.13 billion from $ 7.03 billion .####[]
None And Unisys is expected to do little better than break even in the fourth quarter .####[]
None So Steve Milunovich at First Boston said he is cutting his earnings estimate for next year to $ 2 a share from $ 3 .####[]
None " I was feeling like I was too high to begin with , " he said .####[]
None Mr. Weil of Weil & Associates said he will remain at $ 1 a share for next year but said he wonders whether even that low target is at risk .####[]
None " The break - even point for next year is much lower , but is it low enough ? " he asked .####[]
None Reflecting the concern , Unisys stock fell a further 75 cents to $ 16.25 in composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange .####[]

None The Republic of China government believes in the US commitment to separating its anti-terrorism campaign from the Taiwan Strait issue , a senior Ministry of Foreign Affairs ( MOFA ) official said Thursday .####[]
None Stanley Kao , director of MOFA 's North American Affairs Department , made the remarks amid mounting concerns about the possibility that the United States could compromise Taiwan 's interests in exchange for mainland China 's cooperation in the current US - led war on global terrorism .####[([20, 48], [16, 18], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None Kao said US President George W. Bush 's trip to Shanghai is mainly to attend the annual informal leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) forum to seek expansion of the anti-terrorism coalition .####[([31, 37], [30, 31], [1, 2], 'Positive', 'Weak')]
None Prior to his departure for Shanghai , Bush said during his meeting with mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin , he will reaffirm to Jiang the US support for the " one China " policy as well as its desire to see a peaceful solution to all disputes between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait .####[([0], [46, 49], [8, 9], 'Negative', 'Average'), ([42, 56], [38, 40], [8, 9], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([25, 56], [21, 23], [8, 9], 'Positive', 'Weak'), ([30, 35], [26, 28], [8, 9], 'Positive', 'Average')]

None " We believe in the sincerity of the United States in promising not to mix up its counter-terrorism drive with the Taiwan Strait issue , " Kao said , adding that relevant US officials have on many occasions reaffirmed similar commitments to the ROC .####[([8, 26], [2, 4], [27, 28], 'Positive', 'Weak'), ([39, 45], [38, 39], [27, 28], 'Positive', 'Weak')]
None Commenting on a Washington Post report that the Bush administration was considering waiving sanctions that bar sales of military - related equipment to mainland China , Kao said MOFA is trying to obtain more information about the report .####[]
None In his view , Kao said the cross-strait balance of military power is critical to the ROC 's national security .####[]
None Noting that the United States has consistently attached great importance to Asia-Pacific regional stability and security , Kao said the robust US arms sales package to Taiwan struck in April this year signifies that the United States is serious about security in the region .####[([11, 17], [6, 8], [18, 19], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None Against this backdrop , Kao said , the ROC government is optimistic about defense cooperation with the United States .####[([13, 20], [11, 12], [5, 6], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None Meanwhile , a foreign wire service report from Shanghai quoted a senior US Department of State official as saying Wednesday that the Bush administration has no plans to ease sanctions against mainland China .####[]
None The US official told reporters traveling with Powell en route to Shanghai for an APEC meeting that he unequivocally denied the Washington Post report that said the Bush administration was considering such a move , specifically to allow sales of spare parts for mainland Chinese-owned helicopters as another weapon in the US war on terrorism .####[]
None " There 's no such sale or waiver contemplated , " he said .####[]
None The Post quoted US officials as saying the White House was considering a waiver of sanctions imposed after the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown in Beijing to allow the sale of parts for Black Hawks that Washington sold to mainland China in the 1980s .####[]

None The " intensity target " proposed allows for further increases in absolute emissions and is not sufficient to effectively fight climate change .####[]
None On the contrary , the Kyoto Protocol requires most industrialised countries to achieve absolute emission reductions , while they still foresee to have growing economies .####[]

None President Bush took up the matter of the " axis of evil " and Japan 's economic recovery as topics at the beginning of the summit talks .####[]
None As this indicates , discussion on the " axis of evil " was the main purpose of the President 's visit to Japan .####[]
None The prime minister announced his cooperation with the United States because he fully understands that " the United States needs Japan 's cooperation , " ( said a senior Foreign Ministry official ) .####[]
None Saying that " all options are on the table " to deal with the " axis of evil , " the President also stated at the summit talks that he would " seek a peaceful settlement . "####[([34, 38], [31, 34], [21, 23], 'Positive', 'Weak')]
None He explained a view aimed at solving the issue through diplomatic and other means for the time being .####[]

None Since President Bush envisions using all options , however , we cannot deny the possibility that the United States may take military actions .####[]
None The biggest concern in that case would be Japan 's military support system .####[]
None It seems that the government will enact the law for emergencies in an area surrounding Japan if the United States takes military actions against North Korea .####[]
None But the reality is that " there are many problems , including role sharing in joint actions with the US military , that we need to settle if we want to apply the law , " ( said a Defense Agency source ) .####[]
None Also , there is a possibility of armed attacks on Japan .####[]
None But improvement has not yet been made to the emergency legislation system .####[]
None In the case of military actions against Iran on the other hand , it also seems that " judging from the lessons we learned from the Gulf War , Japan , which relies on the crude oil from the Middle East , cannot refuse offering cooperation , " ( said a Defense Agency source ) .####[]
None There is a strong view among officials of the government and the ruling parties that application of the law for special measures to deal with terrorism would be difficult because this law is limited to dealing with the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States only .####[]
None Moreover , Iraq is expected to fight back if it is attacked .####[]
None This will lead us to the issue of exercising the right of collective self-defense .####[]
None Therefore , the Japanese Government will be forced to introduce diverse legislation for the purpose of giving cooperation for US military actions .####[]

None Those statues probably had n't been a good likeness of him , anyway .####[]
None His clothes probably never looked quite like that - the statues ' fashion sense had been clearly influenced by the Greeks , what with Alexander the Great having passed through on his way to giving up with India .####[]

None Work out your salvation with diligence . "####[]
None So he is unlikely to have been enamoured of statues .####[([9, 11], [3, 9], [3], 'Negative', 'Weak')]

None The other had a big hole in its crotch , at which someone had launched a rocketpropelled grenade back in ' 98 .####[]
None Judging by its demeanour , the statue had n't felt a thing .####[]

None Which was most disturbing of all , because such was the very sin that rocket was supposedly intended to expunge .####[([9, 14], [17, 19], [0], 'Neutral', 'Weak')]
None So those poor bullet-scarred statues made everyone look sad and foolish , and their final immolation a year ago put them out of their misery , so to speak .####[]
None Even at the time , though , this was a stretch for even the most ardent apologist .####[]
None The veil of compassion was hardly elastic enough to pull over those two great big holes in the earth .####[]
None That was the moment at which the fabric of compassion tore , and worlds cracked apart ; when the contrast and conflict of civilisational values became so great as to remove any sense of common ground - even on which to do battle .####[]
None On both sides of the divide after that gratuitously destructive event , anything went .####[]
None And did , spectacularly .####[]
None Of all the unconscionable things the Taliban did to Afghan society in the six years of their reign , their demolition of the Buddhas of Bamiyan last March cleaved the rift between civilisations that was rammed wide open by hijacked aircraft over America just six months later , and which the US has since cauterised with the molten metal of its military might .####[]
None And so it has come ironically to pass that , one year on , a new Afghan order is dreaming of rebuilding those statues , while what 's left of the Taliban now sits in cells a world away , beardless , bald and clad in saffron .####[([21, 25], [19, 21], [16, 19], 'Positive', 'Weak')]

None So this new version has new bases .####[]
None Contrary to the preceding one , the plan proposed by Washington Thursday thus no longer has any binding procedure and is based on voluntary measures and tax incentives .####[]
None It advocates a voluntarist approach to the fight against global warming by directly linking the objectives of greenhouse gas reduction to US economic growth .####[([3, 12], [1, 3], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None According to the White House , this should make it possible to reduce " the intensity of greenhouse gas emission generated by the US economy " by 18 % over the next 10 years , an objective described by the Bush Administration as " comparable " to that imposed by the Kyoto Protocol .####[]
None For the moment Mr. Bush simply proposes to curb the increase in harmful gas emissions and is counting on the good will of US industrialists , who account for 36 % of the greenhouse gas produced by industrialized countries ( as opposed to 31.6 % for Europe ) .####[([0], [21, 23], [4, 5], 'Positive', 'Average')]

None The Discontent of the Environmentalists####[([0], [1, 3], [4, 5], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None As far as the US Administration is concerned , this approach will make it posible to " stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere in the long run , while sustaining the economic growth needed to finance our investments in a new , cleaner energy structure . "####[]
None The White House hastened to describe the Bush plan as " the most audacious program in American history aiming at reducing power station gas emissions , " considering that it would be possible to save the administration up to $ 1 billion , compared to the costs that binding rules would lead to .####[([48, 50], [27, 29], [1, 3], 'Neutral', 'Weak'), ([7, 11], [3, 7], [1, 3], 'Neutral', 'Weak')]

None oh yeah i i guess there 's a lot to to think about when you 're trying to make that decision####[]
None yeah you know the less actually the less you spend on a car it seems like luxury cars they 're called luxury cars even though they 're much more expensive like like uh um a Mercedes Benz they do n't have the history of breaking down or things like that that would go wrong would definitely not be considered disposable####[]
None right####[]
None you would never think of having to replace the clutch in a Mercedes####[]

None Even More " Proving Rape "####[]
None Chatterbox feels that the Wall Street Journal editorial page 's coverage of Juanita Broaddrick 's rape charges against Bill Clinton ( see " Proving Rape , " " More Proving Rape , " as well as Michael Kinsley 's " Readme " column in the current issue ) cries out for the introduction of the Scientific Method into the usually mushy business of assessing press responsibility .####[([4, 21], [2, 3], [0, 1], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None With that in mind , Chatterbox hereby inaugurates the Intellectual Dishonesty ( henceforth to be known as the Indis ) Index .####[]
None Here 's how it works :####[]
None Publications that refuse to acknowledge ( even if to refute the importance of ) highly significant but inconvenient facts in their news or opinion coverage of controversial events will score one point for the initial offense .####[]
None They will then score one point for every subsequent issue or broadcast or Internet posting after the first offense is noted by Chatterbox if they continue not to report said inconvenient fact -- and an additional two points on days when the news organization runs a follow - up without making note of said inconvenient fact .####[([18, 20], [21, 22], [22, 24], 'Negative', None)]
None Publications receiving a score of 10 will be inducted into the Indis Hall of Fame .####[]
None Publications that get all the way up to 20 will be faxed a likeness of Joseph Stalin .####[]
None ( Chatterbox would prefer not to invoke the phrase " intellectual dishonesty , " because it 's pompous and falsely suggests that only intellectuals can be intellectually dishonest .####[([10, 14], [3, 14], [1, 2], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None But Chatterbox does n't know any other easily understandable phrase that describes this particular kind of offense . )####[]
None For the purposes of this survey , the Wall Street Journal will be counted as a separate and distinct publication from the Journal 's editorial page , because , in essence , it is .####[]
None The Journal editorial page continues not to acknowledge that Norma Kelsey , the friend and employee to Juanita Broaddrick who is one of two people partially corroborating Broaddrick 's rape accusation , is the daughter of a man whose murderer was pardoned by Gov. Bill Clinton .####[]
None ( A responsible account of the whole controversy in today 's New York Times reports that Kelsey says the pardon had nothing to do with her corroboration . )####[]
None The Journal editorial page gets one point for failing to note the pardon in its initial Op - Ed by Dorothy Rabinowitz on Feb. 19 .####[]
None Because it has published three times since the initial omission , it scores an additional three points .####[]
None And because it published an editorial Feb. 22 taunting the rest of the press for not following it on the story -- and still did n't mention the pardon -- it scores an extra two points .####[]
None That comes to a total of six .####[]
None Chatterbox feels certain that the Journal editorial page will provide some follow - up tomorrow to tonight 's NBC broadcast of its own Broaddrick interview , which means that if the Journal editorial page continues to take no action it will be in the Indis Hall of Fame by Monday at the latest !####[]
None Chatterbox considered but rejected the idea of awarding Rabinowitz bonus points for having " eventually convinced " Broaddrick to grant an interview to the New York Times ( as the Times reports in today 's story ) .####[]
None But the Scientific Method does not permit any tinkering with the Indis Index 's scoring procedures .####[]
None And besides , Rabinowitz 's efforts on the Times ' behalf were n't really unethical , just puzzling , given the two newspapers ' intense rivalry .####[]
None When Chatterbox asked the Journal 's DC bureau chief , Alan Murray , who exercised good judgment in not breaking the Broaddrick story ( and - - full disclosure -- is Chatterbox 's former boss ) , to comment about a Journal employee 's feeding sources to the Times , he replied : " I do n't really have any comment on what the edit page did .####[]
None They do their thing , we do ours . "####[]
None Which is what Journal news employees are instructed to say whenever the editorial page causes them cringing embarrassment .####[]
None For her part , Rabinowitz explains to Chatterbox that her efforts on behalf of the Times were more indifferent than the Times made them sound .####[]
None " Ms. Broaddrick told me Sunday that a Times reporter had appeared at the house in the a.m. , and that she had refused an interview , " Rabinowitz writes in an e-mail message .####[]
None " I asked her why she had decided to talk to the New York Post 's Steve Dunleavy , and refused a Times reporter .####[]
None She said Dunleavy caught her by surprise .####[]
None She asked if I thought it would be all right to talk to the Times reporter .####[]
None I told her it would be -- certainly as all right as talking to Dunleavy .####[]
None She said , ' Well , I 'm sorry I did n't . '####[]
None She said she would if he called again .####[]
None I passed this on to [ Times reporter ] Felicity Barringer during our second day 's interview chat .####[]

None Dushanbe , 21 July : A patrol of Russia 's border guards discovered two sacks filled with narcotics on the Moskva border detachment 's section of the Tajik - Afghan border on Friday [ 20 July ] .####[]
None An expert examination showed that the sacks contained 86.9 kilos of pure heroin , head of the press service of Russia 's Border Troops in Tajikistan Colonel Aleksandr Kondratyev told ITAR - TASS on Saturday .####[]
None Drug dealers have lost some 3,600 kilos of narcotics including more than a tonne of heroin on the Tajik - Afghan border since the beginning of the year , the colonel said .####[]
None During the year 2000 border guards confiscated 2,950 kilos of drugs , including 670 kilos of heroin , Kondratyev noted .####[]
None Recent weeks have seen important developments on both sides of the Atlantic for the policy pursued in combating climate change .####[]
None In Europe , the council of environment ministers concluded a formal political agreement on 4 March on the decision to ratify the Kyoto Protocol before 1 June this year .####[]
None With this major decision , the European Union is opening the door to the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol for climate protection just in time for the world summit on sustainable development to be held in August 2002 in Johannesburg .####[]
None In the United States , on 14 February President Bush presented the US national climate protection program .####[]
None It should be remembered that after Bush described the Kyoto Protocol as " fundamentally flawed " international negotiations on climate protection almost collapsed .####[]
None The United States , the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases ( 25 percent of global emissions ) withdrew from an international agreement that , for the first time , set binding targets for developed countries for climate protection .####[]
None We now know that the US withdrawal did not stop the world community from deepening this important multilateral agreement for combating climate change .####[]
None The European Union played a dominant role in these negotiations and the community of states concluded , at the Bonn and Marrakech conferences of July and October last year , an agreement that sets out how to implement the Kyoto Protocol and provides for an original mechanism for respecting the reduction obligations that could possibly serve as a model for other agreements and that suggests a possible strengthening of international institutional structures in the environmental field .####[]
None This must now be ratified by all the parties and will shortly enter into force .####[]
None However , all the parties repeated with insistence that world climate protection cannot be effective unless the United States takes measures that are comparable to these taken by Europe and Japan .####[]
None Unfortunately , the recent US climate protection program falls far short of meeting such expectations .####[]
None Although there is a certain satisfaction at seeing President Bush recognize the need to fight climate change , that must not in any way conceal the extreme weakness of what he announced .####[]
None Under the US program , US emissions as a proportion of GDP must fall by 18 percent between 2002 and 2012 , or in other words energy efficiency must increase by 18 percent .####[]
None This can hardly be described as ambitious as a 15 percent increase in energy efficiency was in any event expected given present productivity levels .####[]
None In addition , if the US economy continues to grow , the increased energy efficiency will be cancelled out or more than cancelled out .####[]
None With an annual economic growth objective of 3 percent , absolute US emissions in 2012 will be 24.5 percent more than 1990 levels , despite the improvement in energy efficiency .####[]
None By comparison , respect for the Kyoto Protocol requires the EU to reduce its emissions by 8 percent compared with 1990 , Japan by 6 percent , and the United States by 7 percent , a figure accepted by President Clinton in 1997 .####[([6, 8], [3, 5], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None The warnings by climate experts went unheeded in the US climate protection program .####[([0], [1, 3], [3, 6], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None In its last report , the IPCC [ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ] called for rapid and decisive action to at least avert the most serious consequences of climate change .####[([17, 21], [14, 16], [6, 8], 'Positive', 'Weak')]
None Scientists estimate that the industrialized countries must reduce their emissions to around 70 percent by 2020 to maintain climate change at an acceptable level .####[]
None Researchers have shown that without a determined policy on climate coordinated at international level the consequences of climate change will be dramatic .####[]
None The average global temperature will increase by 5.8d C by 2100 , sea levels will rise by up to 90 cm over the same period , and there will be an increasing number of hurricanes with ever more serious consequences , while man and nature will have to cope with a shift in climate and rainfall zones the like of which has never been seen before .####[]
None At our instigation , on 4 March EU environment ministers therefore called on the United States to " assume its responsibilities under the framework agreement on climate change , " that is to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels and strengthen domestic actions to bring them into line with the level of effort accepted by the industrial countries in application of the Kyoto Protocol .####[([14, 30], [11, 14], [8, 10], 'Neutral', 'Weak')]
None If the effects of climate change were not so devastating and our action were to be guided by economic competition , we Europeans could welcome the fact that the United States is not committing itself to an ambitious climate protection program , in so far as the technologies in the field of energy efficiency and renewable energy are the technologies of the future .####[([26, 43], [24, 26], [22, 23], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None Anybody who fails to exploit these markets from the outset will remain lagging behind .####[]
None Demand for these technologies is increasing worldwide .####[]
None The " three liters for 100 kilometers " car , high efficiency turbines , and solar panels are export successes and their development is driven by a climate protection policy of growing amplitude .####[]
None Even today it is difficult to find buyers outside the United States for the fuel- guzzling cars of the US automobile industry .####[]
None US reticence is not therefore a reason for us to reduce our climate protection efforts .####[]
None The dominant role of the European climate protection policy has benefits for our economy .####[]
None Many studies show that an active policy of climate protection is not in any way contrary to a policy of full employment .####[]
None On the contrary , it can have a positive effect .####[]
None By implementing our European and national climate protection programs we will succeed in creating several hundred thousand new jobs by 2010 .####[]
None We hope that the United States will come to realize that an active climate protection policy is not only necessary for environmental policy but is also an excellent opportunity to modernize industrial society .####[([4, 34], [2, 3], [1, 2], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None The Kyoto Protocol is a first major step .####[]
None It should therefore be implemented as quickly as possible and extended beyond the initial period of 2008 - 2012 .####[]
None The return of the United States to the system must remain our goal .####[]
None The door remains wide open for the United States to return to the Kyoto process :####[]
None The biggest emitter of greenhouse gases cannot be relieved of its responsibilities for global climate protection .####[]

None Crossland Savings####[]
None Bank 's stock plummeted after management recommended a suspension of dividend payments on both its common and preferred stock because Crossland may not meet the new government capital criteria effective Dec. 7 .####[]
None In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday , Crossland closed at $ 5.25 , down $ 1.875 , a 26 % decline .####[]
None A spokesman said the savings bank may not qualify for the capital requirements because , under the proposed guidelines , its $ 380 million of preferred stock does n't meet the " core capital " criteria outlined under the new Financial Institutions Reform , Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 .####[]
None He added that final guidelines to be published in early November will determine whether the bank is in compliance .####[]
None Crossland said it retained three investment bankers to assist it in developing and implementing a financial restructuring plan .####[]
None It would n't identify the bankers .####[]
None Additionally , Crossland reported a third - quarter loss of $ 175.5 million , or $ 13.44 a share , compared with net income of $ 27.1 million , or $ 1.16 a share , a year ago .####[]
None A major factor in the third - quarter loss was the write-down of $ 143.6 million of goodwill .####[]
None The spokesman said that the proposed guidelines caused Crossland to revise its business objectives and , consequently , to write down the asset value of some previous acquisitions .####[]
None Crossland recorded an additional $ 20 million in loan loss reserves in the third quarter .####[]
None Net interest income for the third quarter declined to $ 35.6 million from $ 70.1 million a year ago .####[]
None However , non-interest income rose to $ 23.5 million from $ 22 million .####[]
None Third - quarter loan originations dropped sharply to $ 663 million from $ 1 billion a year ago .####[]
None Standard & Poor's Corp .####[]
None lowered the rating on Crossland 's preferred stock to double - C from single - B-minus and placed it on CreditWatch for possible further downgrade .####[]

None About $ 518 million of debt is affected .####[]
None The US President is giving two kinds of speeches .####[]
None The first is improvised and not devoid of slips of the tongue .####[]
None The second is carefully written and studied from every aspect , and represents the official policy of the country .####[]
None There is controversy about which type is more credible .####[]
None Perhaps improvisation is a better indication of the inclinations and personal convictions of the President , because by improvising he is expressing what runs through his mind since the tongue is an extension of the heart .####[]
None On the other hand , written speeches are more indicative of the policy drafted by the decision -making circles for a final decision by the President .####[]
None The State of the Union Address , given by the President in a joint meeting of the House of Representatives and Senate every year , is a pre-prepared speech .####[]
None Every phrase in it was carefully studied , particularly the phrase that referred to Iran , Iraq , and North Korea as an axis of evil .####[]
None Axis is a term that was created by Mussolini signifying the alliance of Germany , Italy , and Japan .####[]
None As for evil , it is a term used by former President Reagan to describe the Soviet Union , although its evil was self- destructive , causing the country to collapse from within .####[([16, 19], [14, 16], [10, 14], 'Neutral', 'Weak')]
None The new axis of evil , which Bush has come up with , by combining the words of Mussolini and Reagan , was not a successful choice .####[]
None If it was viable to describe terrorist organizations as evil , then it is not viable to do the same for countries .####[]
None Besides , politicians refer to good and evil only for purposes of intimidation and exaggeration .####[]
None During World War II , the axis countries were very strong and bound by an alliance .####[]
None The new axis , however , represents small developing countries that are not linked by any alliance or cooperation .####[]
None In fact , Iraq and Iran were involved in the longest destructive war during the second half of the 20th century .####[]
None As for North Korea , it is a country living in isolation and is keeping its good and evil from everyone else .####[]
None Its name was only mentioned in the axis of evil to remove suspicion around the United States ' hostility to Islam .####[([21, 22], [18, 20], [15, 18], 'Negative', 'Strong'), ([1, 3], [4, 6], [0], 'Neutral', 'Weak')]
None As for Iran , the United States is eager to open a dialogue with it , especially since the reform school in Iran is progressing at the expense of the traditional , conservative school .####[]
None It is very unlikely that the United States would be involved in a war with it .####[]

None The line that Bush draws between friends and foes has never been any clearer .####[]

None The countries that possess the lethal weapons are the targets of suppression by the United States .####[]
None A close look will show that the United States has already carried out this aggressive policy in abrupt and rapid manner without comprehensively consulting with the countries concerned .####[]
None For example , some 660 US soldiers have been dispatched to the Philippines to join Filipino soldiers to suppress the Abu Sayyaf .####[]
None Although the US role is identified as participation in military exercise or as adviser , the real purpose is the soldiers are sent there to participate in missions that the targets are the groups that are regarded as enemies of the United States .####[([33, 35], [36, 38], [41, 44], 'Negative', 'Weak')]
None The new US policy deserves to be closely analyzed and monitored .####[]

None It was written , the episode was broadcast live , and there was no way that those words from the president of the Republic were adulterated , deformed , or falsified by the hidden agents of the media conspiracy .####[]

None He asserted , in these exact words , this barbarism : " 4 February is not just any date , it is a historic date we can well compare to 19 April 1810 , when that civic-military rebellion also opened a new path towards national independence . "####[]
None No one had gone so far in the anthology of rhetorical follies , or in falsifying history .####[]
None No one had ever tried to compare themselves to , and put themselves in the same position , as the founders of the nation , as the thwarted leader of the 4 February 1992 coup has now tried to do .####[]
None What is there about a coup against the constitutional order that could resemble the most important day in Venezuelan history ?####[]
None In what way can Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chavez be seen as comparable to Jose Felix Ribas , Francisco Salias , the philosopher Juan German Roscio , or Canon Jose Cortes de Madariaga ?####[]
None No .####[]
None This is a simple lack of respect , an abuse of history , an unacceptable degradation .####[]
None Chavez did not try to overthrow Fernando VII , and if it had been up to him we would still be under the domination of the Bourbon dynasty .####[]
None 4 February is one of the most terrible days in Venezuelan history .####[]
None If he wants to look for a comparison , maybe he would find one in the likewise thwarted coup by Colonel Pedro Carujo against Jose Maria Vargas .####[([5, 9], [3, 4], [2], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None Comparing it with 19 April 1810 is another armed coup and must be rejected with all determination by the academies and by those who in one way or another must preserve our historical legacy from adulteration or deceitful use .####[([0, 7], [13, 18], [18, 35], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None 4 February upset the lives of Venezuelans with the ghost of a military insurgency that we had all thought had been overcome , because it belonged to past eras and because the armed forces were fully within the legitimate order , complying with institutional precepts , far from the meddling forbidden by the constitution .####[]
None In fact , the armed forces made great contributions to the country 's stability , because when each sector of Venezuelan society complies with what is set out for it in the legal order , countries are preserved from the vicissitudes of coup plotters .####[]
None President Chavez himself now boasts of having spent 20 years conspiring -- that is , eroding the armed forces ' loyalty -- to achieve his goal of conquering power .####[([23, 30], [4, 6], [0, 2], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None This is a great demonstration of political cynicism .####[]
None 4 February was not only a military failure for Chavez ; it was also an episode that caused enormous losses , human and economic , for all Venezuelans .####[]
None There were numerous deaths , and no one can feel proud of the consequences .####[([13, 15], [9, 12], [7, 9], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None 4 February was such a failure that Chavez , even though it pained him , had to accept democratic methods to reach power .####[([17, 24], [12, 15], [7, 9], 'Negative', 'Strong')]

None Chapter 5 A Physics of Semantics ?####[]
None ach of the chapters of Investigations broaches new territory .####[]
None Each is tentative and incomplete , pointing but not fully adequate .####[]
None Yet , I persistently hope , it is better to light one candle against . . . what ?####[]
None the darkness ?####[]
None the veil beyond which we have had no framework of questions before ?####[]
None There are grounds , reasoned about by the best of philosophers and scientists of the past several centuries , to doubt a physics of semantics .####[]
None We are on shaky ground .####[]
None Yet when the first hard frost comes , when the birches have been swung , their crimson leaves scattered carelessly , when crystals splint shallow ponds and old egrets stand dark watch the coming dawn , long-legged , knowing how winter is thin , when the first phase transition of water to ice forms slight solidity across meadow streams , small creatures of flesh and concept tiptoe gingerly to some far side where , perhaps , something new is to be found .####[]
None We have lacked a physical definition of an autonomous agent , able to manipulate the universe on its own behalf the egret whose foreboding of winter leads to lifted wing and steady , powerful flight .####[]
None The egret is as much a part of physical reality as the atom , and perhaps more than the vaunted quark .####[]
None But autonomous agents , we who do daily manipulate the world on our own behalf , we to whom ``intentionality '' and ``purpose '' are so inevitably attributed by our common languages , we are , by my definition of autonomous agents , also nothing but physical systems with a peculiar organization of processes and properties .####[]
None If the concept of autonomous agents were something like a useful or more , a proper definition of life itself , then autonomous agents span the gap from the merely physical to that new realm of the merely physical where ``purpose ' ' is ascribed by all of us to one another .####[]
None Semantics enters with purpose .####[]
None For this to be true , it is not necessary that the carriers of purpose , say , the same bacterium heading upstream in the glucose gradient , be conscious .####[]
None I hope my definition of an autonomous agent is useful , an autocatalytic system carrying out a work cycle , now rather broadened by the realization that autonomous agents also do often detect and measure and record displacements of external systems from equilibrium that can be used to extract work , then do extract work , propagating work and constraint construction , from their environment .####[]
None Know-how Bring ourselves empathetically and objectively back three billion years to the mixed microbial community flourishing right about where most of us are now , plus or minus a modicum of layers of surface crustal material .####[]
None I want to say that the autonomous agents comprising that community had , individually and collectively , the embodied know - how to get on with making a living in the natural games that constituted their world .####[]
None Indeed , as I have emphasized before , a biosphere is a self-consistent coconstruction of autonomous agents , ways of making a living , and the search procedures , mutation , recombination , as well as behavioral search open to autonomous agents .####[]
None Those means of making a living that were well searched out and mastered by the agents and their search procedures became the kinds of ``jobs ' ' that were widely filled , the abundant niches of the bio-sphere .####[]
None There is in this whole self - constructing system a wider know-how , beyond the know - how of any single autonomous agent spinning eagerly in its microenvironment .####[]
None Yet , clearly , the know -how is distributed .####[]
None There is no autonomous agent , no one , who knows how the whole system works , any more than anyone at present knows how the global economic system works in its myriad interactions , deals , steals , hopes , and frustrations .####[]
None What in the world is ``know-how ' ' ?####[]
None Philosophers distinguish between ``know-how '' and ``know that . ''####[]
None I know how to tie my shoes and am learning how to play jazz drums .####[]
None ` ` Know that '' concerns propositions , most conveniently , human propositions .####[]
None I know that the moon is they tell me not made of green cheese .####[]
None I know that the earth circles the sun , that the earth is roughly spherical , that chairs are used to sit on .####[]
None ` ` Know that '' brings with it the standard and nonstandard issues of the truth or falseness of propositions as they report states of the world .####[]
None Perhaps higher primates who are trained to manipulate simple symbols with apparent reference to the world also can ``know that '' with respect to propositions .####[]
None Unlike ``know that , '' ``know - how ' ' does not involve propositions about the world .####[]
None `` Know-how '' involves procedural knowledge about how to get on in the world .####[]
None The cheetah streaking after the wildebeest , the athletic genius high jumping , have the know -how to do it .####[]
None Does a bacterium know how to make a living in its world ?####[]
None I certainly want to say yes , without attributing consciousness in any way .####[([0], [3, 4], [1], 'Neutral', None)]
None Watch the myriad subtle turnings on and o of genes , metabolic switching , mechanical twitching , sensing of glucose gradient , swimming and tumbling upstream to higher glucose concentrations .####[]
None It knows how all right , even if it cannot talk about how it gets on with its business .####[]
None But then , try to talk about tying your shoes or the skilled driving when you become aware some dozens of miles down the road that you have accomplished the tasks without paying the slightest focused attention .####[]
None Thank God for know-how .####[]
None Know that is a thin veneer on a four-billion - year - old know - how skill abundant in the biosphere .####[]
None But any autonomous agent proliferating alone or in a congery of other agents , it would seem , is also graced by the selfsame know-how .####[]
None If we synthesize autonomous agents in the next decades and they coevolve under our rapt gaze over months or years into a modestly complex ecosystem brimming with novel life forms , they too will know how to make a living in their mutually created world plus the boundary conditions we more or less intelligently impose on them .####[]
None The know- how is , in these terms , nothing but another view of the propagating closures of catalysis , work tasks , sensing , recording , and acting that we now recognize as inherent in the doings of autonomous agents .####[]
None The know - how is not outside that propagating organization .####[]
None The know-how is the propagating organization .####[]
None Semantics####[]
None All of which brings us , inevitably , to the brink of semantics .####[]
None It is simple at its roots , you see .####[]
None An incoming molecular species arriving in the interior of an autonomous agent really is ( i ) food ; ( ii ) poison ; ( iii ) a signal ; ( iv ) neutral ; ( v ) something else .####[]
None Once there is an autonomous agent , there is a semantics from its privileged point of view .####[]
None The incoming molecule is ``yuck '' or ``yum . ''####[]
None I think the major conceptual step to yuck or yum is unavoidable once there is an autonomous agent .####[]
None And I think we have roughly the Darwinian criteria in mind .####[([0], [3, 4], [2], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None If yum , then there will probably be more of this type of agent , osprings of the first .####[]
None If yuck , it is not so likely this lineage will prosper .####[]
None Once yuck and yum , we are not far from C. S. Pierce ' s meaning - laden semiotic triad : sign , signified , significans .####[]
None Like it or not , the glucose gradient is a sign , a predictor , of ``more glucose that way . ''####[]
None Granted , the glucose is not an arbitrary symbol , any more than a cloud is an arbitrary symbol of rain .####[]
None In this restricted sense , signs are causally correlated with that which is signified .####[]
None By contrast , the relation between the word ``chair '' and that which it signifies , and on which I am now sitting , is arbitrary .####[]
None But can chemical signals in bacterial and plant and human communities be arbitrary from a chemical causal point of view ?####[]
None If so , can ``mere chemicals ' ' be signs in the full Piercean sense ?####[]
None I believe it is clear that mere chemistry in an autonomous agent can harbor symbols and signs in the full senses of the words .####[([4, 25], [1, 3], [1], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None Consider first the famous genetic code .####[]
None Triplets of nucleotides in an RNA molecule stand for specific amino acids that will end up incorporated into a protein .####[]
None The detailed causal machinery involves transfer RNA molecules with their anticodon site and the distant site to which amino acids are attached , the aminoacyle transferase enzymes that charge the amino acid binding site of each transfer RNA with the proper amino acid among the twenty amino acids , the binding of the charged transfer RNA ' s anticodon site to the proper RNA code word triplet , the ribosome that glides between adjacent charged transfer RNA molecules and links the successive amino acids into the growing polypeptide chain that hangs free in the cytoplasm , tethered by the ribosome to the messenger RNA molecule as it is ``translated .####[]
None ' '####[]
None The arbitrariness of the genetic code is exemplified by the evolution of novel transfer RNA molecules , which translate a given messenger RNA code word triplet into a dierent amino acid .####[]
None As J. Monod properly emphasized three decades ago in a slightly dierent context concerning activation and inhibition of enzymes at allosteric sites on the enzyme that are distant from the catalytic site , the relation of chemical structures that achieve control of catalysis are utterly arbitrary with respect to the chemical structures that undergo the catalysis .####[]
None The same is true of the transfer RNA where the anticodon site is distant from the amino acid binding site .####[]
None Because of this , which amino acid is charged onto a particular transfer RNA is utterly arbitrary and controlled by the aminoacyle transferase enzyme that does the charging , plus the structure of the amino acid binding site on the transfer RNA .####[]
None Both of these can be altered without altering the anticodon-codon matching mechanism .####[]
None In short , chemistry allows arbitrary organizations of control relations .####[]
None It seems fully legitimate to assign the concepts of sign , signified , and significans to the genetic code .####[]
None It seems legitimate to extend that notion to much of the subtle signaling , chemical and otherwise , within and between autonomous agents , as exemplified by plants that upon infestation by a particular insect secrete a secondary metabolite chemical that ``warns ' ' other members of the same species that an insect infestation is happening and to turn on defensive anti-insect secondary metabolites .####[]
None The calculus that is Claude Shannon ' s elegant information theory has always been about reduction of uncertainty about the statistics of the source of a set of symbols .####[]
None Nowhere in the core of Shannon ' s work concerning the encoding and transmission of information does the meaning , or semantics , of the information enter .####[]
None This is no criticism , and is widely known and appreciated .####[]
None There is , however , just a hint of semantics in Shannon ' s view that the semantics resides in the ``decoder . ''####[]
None I cannot buy Shannon ' s view unless the decoder is an autonomous agent .####[]
None If not , then the decoder merely transforms a bit string sent along a communication channel into some other discrete or continuous dynamics perhaps a set of water - filled bowls is drained by turning on a machine that opens valves between the bowls and to the outside world in particular ways .####[]
None The patterns of bowl drainage upon receipt of the binary string messages sent along the communication channel constitutes the decoding .####[]
None But if the recipient is an autonomous agent such as a bacterium and the incoming molecule is a symbol-sign of a paramecium or an amoeba on the roam and the bacterium swims away and avoids becoming dinner , that sequence of events seems laden with semantics .####[]
None If only the bacterium could tell us : ` ` Did you see that truck of a paramecium coming at me ?####[]
None I ' ve run into that one before !####[]
None I ducked under a boulder , and he never sensed me .####[]
None I made it home .####[]
None Pass me some more glucose please , Martha . ''####[]
None I will return in the next chapter to discuss such stories , for I will say that we cannot prestate the configuration space of a biosphere and , therefore , cannot deduce that which will unfold .####[]
None Thus , among other things , we must tell stories to understand the oriented actions of agents in their worlds .####[]
None Do not be overly quick to accuse me of anthropomorphizing .####[]
None I too know the risks , including the common claim that we can always in principle translate from ``intentional talk '' to the fully predictive causal account of the events in question .####[]
None But patience .####[]
None Not only are we unable to prestate the configuration space of a biosphere and predict what will unfold , but we also cannot even translate in the sense of necessary and sucient conditions from legal talk to normal intentional talk , let alone from legal talk of Henderson found guilty of murder to a physical talk about sound -wave forms monitored and masses at space - time lines as a description .####[]
None Then let ' s just be naive for the moment .####[]
None The semantics of the yuck or yum coming into a simple autonomous agent say , an early bacterium is somehow linked with the embodied know - how of that agent in making a living , or failing to make a living , in its world .####[]
None The semantics of an event is some subset of the fully embroidered , context - dependent set of causal implications of the event , or signal , in question .####[]
None ` ` For want of a nail , the shoe was lost ; for want of the shoe , the horse was lost ; and for want of the horse , the rider was lost , '' more or less , said Benjamin Franklin .####[]
None The semantics of the nail is some subset of this embroidered context- dependent set of implications of the event , or signal , in question to the autonomous agents in the coevolving system .####[]
None It seems hard to ascribe purpose , in the sense of acting on its own behalf , to a stone or a chair and easy with respect to an alga .####[]
None Of course , there is a sense in which my attribution of semantics to autonomous agents is purely tautological .####[]
None After all , I began by stating that a bacterium swimming upstream in the glucose gradient was acting on its own behalf in an environment , defined an autonomous agent as a physical system able to act on its own behalf , then asked what a physical system must be such that it can act on its own behalf .####[]
None Now , five chapters later , it is hardly an independent deduction that autonomous agents are the proposed organization of matter , energy , and organization to which purposes can be ascribed in the sense of being able to act on their own behalf .####[]
None My definition is a definitional circle .####[]
None On the other hand , while the definition is circular , like F = MA and Darwin ' s ``natural selection '' and ``fitness , '' that does not mean that the set of codefined concepts surrounding my definition of an autonomous agent as a reproducing system that does a work cycle fails to touch the real world .####[]
None Stones and chairs are not , by my definition , autonomous agents .####[]
None All living cells are .####[]
None And the stunning fact directly before us , every day , is that autonomous agents do manipulate the world on their own behalf .####[]
None Watch a pair of nesting birds build their nest .####[]
None In short , once we have autonomous agents and yuck and yum , it appears that semantics enters the universe as the agents coevolve and behave on their own behalf with one another in the unfolding of a biosphere .####[]
None Knowing####[]
None What about ``knowing '' ? Daniel Dennett , in his fine book Darwin ' s Dangerous Idea , advances a hierarchy of forms of ``knowing , '' if I may use that term , that have arisen in evolution by Darwinian means .####[]
None I find his hierarchy congenial and informative .####[]
None Dennett envisions evolution as a sequence of kinds of construction cranes that bit by bit build up higher - order entities via variation and natural selection .####[]
None I do not disagree , although I have placed far greater emphasis on the roles of self-organization in evolution .####[]
None Here , in Investigations , I am trying to point at the mysterious but utterly natural hopefulness in which an increasing diversity of broken symmetries in the universe creates the diversity of structures and processes that can constitute and identify ramified and ramifying sources of energy , detect those sources of energy , create devices and processes that couple to those sources of energy , and generate yet more diversity that propagates macroscopic order even further .####[]
None I wonder , in short , at the naturalness and self- generaticity of Dennett ' s cranes building cranes building cranes in biospheres , perhaps planetary geologies , and beyond .####[]
None But back to the past .####[]
None Dennett distinguishes ` `Darwinian creatures , '' ` `Pavlovian creatures , '' ` `Popperian creatures , '' and ``Gregorian creatures . ''####[]
None A simple autonomous agent , say , a bacterium , is a Darwinian creature .####[]
None In its simplest version , the creature evolves by mutation , also recombination and natural selection .####[]
None For the moment , no behavioral learning is to be considered .####[]
None So one ( or a colony or an ecosystem ) of Darwinian creatures adapts more or less as Darwin told us .####[]
None At the next level up , say , aplysia , a nervous system is present , and the creature is capable of stimulus - response learning , a la Pavlov .####[]
None Indeed , aplysia can learn very simple conditioned stimuli the later analogue is the bell causing the dog to salivate in ``expectation '' of food .####[]
None At the next level ( Dennett , perhaps properly , reserves this for us vertebrates ) is the Popperian creature .####[]
None Popperian creatures , in Dennett ' s fine phrase , have ``internal models '' of their world and can ``run the internal model ' ' with the clutch disengaged , rather than running the model in real time in the real world .####[]
None This allows us lucky Popperian creatures to allow our ``hypotheses to die in our stead . ''####[]
None I love that image .####[]
None Beyond the Popperian is the Gregorian creature namely , at least humans .####[]
None Dennett makes the wonderful argument that we utilize our tools literally stone knives , arrows , digging sticks , machine tools to enlarge our shared world of facts and processes .####[]
None This enlarged shared world gives us more know-how , and more know that .####[]
None Cultural evolution , at some point , begins to burst out -of-bounds .####[]
None Hard rock music jangles the minarets of Iran .####[]
None Who knows what new cultural forms will blossom ?####[]
None Chinese cooking lands in Cuba , and Cuban - Chinese cuisine is invented .####[]
None What ' s next under the sun ?####[]
None Who can say ?####[]
None I very much like Dennett ' s ladder of know-how , and eventual know that .####[([4, 16], [2, 4], [1, 2], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None Without invoking consciousness , not because it is not worth invoking but because so little sensible has ever been said on the subject , it seems worth asking how much of this hierarchy could be realized by simple molecular systems , even without evoking nerve cells .####[]
None I would think a lot of this hierarchy could find molecular realizations .####[]
None For example , bacteria and amoebae do have a kind of Pavlovian learning already , for they have receptors that accommodate to a constant level of a given signal ligand and sense instead a change from the current level .####[]
None This is not yet the association of a more or less arbitrary conditioned stimulus with an unconditioned stimulus , but I can imagine chemistry to accomplish the latter .####[]
None As neurons are supposed to proliferate and form novel synaptic connections that survive if used and to mediate the linkage of conditioned to unconditioned stimulus , why not envision a complex chemistry , say , very complex carbohydrate -synthesis patterns sustained by complex sets of enzymes whose activities are modulated by the dierent carbohydrates themselves , which is true of contemporary carbohydrate metabolism .####[]
None Such a system might blindly try out variant patterns of synthesis until it could establish a self-sustaining web linking the carbohydrates , the enzymes , and certain protein receptors mediating the linkage between unconditioned and conditioned stimulus , then maintain that linkage by positive feedback loops .####[]
None The image is not too far from how it is imagined that ``idiotype ' ' and ``anti-idiotype '' immune networks work to sustain synthesis of a set of desired antibodies against an incoming pathogen .####[]
None In such networks , for which there is modestly good evidence , a given first antibody serves as an antigen that stimulates the body to produce a second antibody that binds to the unique amino acid sequences , called the ``idiotype ' ' of the first antibody .####[]
None In turn , the second ``anti-idiotype ' ' antibody stimulates a third , which stimulates a fourth .####[]
None But this series is likely to form feedback loops because the first and third antibody can often both bind to the same site on the second antibody , hence , the first and third antibodies are similar shapes in shape space .####[]
None It is not much of a stretch to think of the immune system as a conditioned stimulus response system .####[]
None Popperian creatures ?####[]
None Why cannot the molecular-sensing and hypothesis-testing churning concerns of the bacterium as it senses a paramecium churn twenty cycles before kicking in the rotary motor , or not , such that the wee bacterium hides under a boulder of a grain of sand until the beast passes by ?####[]
None Are nerves necessary ?####[]
None Plants , as noted , are said to signal one another with complex secondary metabolites to characterize the particular kinds of insects infesting the glade .####[]
None There are arbitrary structural relations between the metabolite and the insect , just as symbols in human language are often arbitrary with respect to the signified .####[]
None Not bad for nerveless nonvertebrates .####[]
None I do get stuck at Gregorian creatures .####[]
None Even here , the free and open creating of new symbol strings in a language , wherever new sentences can be created , is not that fundamentally dierent from the persistent open creation of new kinds of molecules in the biosphere as a whole .####[]
None If the conversation we recent two -legged ones are having with respect to our digging sticks and atomic bombs is impressive , so too is the chemical conversation in any full-fledged ecosystem , where we are all instrumental in the lives of one another .####[]
None I suppose I am naively driven to consider that the biosphere , with its urgent diversity in which , emboldened by all our know - how , we do get on with a very rich conversation , may very early already have harbored all the levels of which Dennett speaks .####[]
None We humans are just more gregarious with our vocal cords and e-mail , I guess .####[]
None Smart place , a biosphere , lots to talk about .####[]
None Four billion years of yammering .####[]
None Slapstick comedy may have started a long time ago .####[]
None Ethics####[]
None And what of ethics ?####[]
None Does a whi of ethical issue arise with autonomous agents ?####[]
None Yuck or yum from my point of view if I am an autonomous agent .####[]
None There are deep reasons for caution .####[]
None Hume told us long ago about the ``naturalistic fallacy '' :####[]
None One cannot deduce ``ought '' from ``is . ''####[]
None From the fact that mothers care for their young , we cannot deduce that they ought to do so , Hume argued .####[]
None From the fact that Hitler set out to conquer Europe and more and to kill Jewry , we cannot deduce that he ought to have done so .####[]
None Indeed , Hume ' s injunction underlies the caution of scientists about making ethical statements .####[]
None We scientists find the facts .####[]
None You citizens across the globe can argue the ethics .####[]
None But if Hume warns us not to deduce ought from is , where do values come from at all ?####[]
None Hume ' s injunction against deduction from is to ought nevertheless began by recognizing the legitimacy of the category ``ought . ''####[]
None The eorts following Hume to understand the meaning of ethical assertions have been long , twisted , arduous .####[]
None Following the dictates of the logical positivists of the Vienna Circle that only those statements capable of verification were meaningful , philosophers as famous as G. E. Moore came to wonder if ethical assertions were merely emotive utterances .####[]
None ` ` It is wrong to kill . ''####[]
None Becomes , ``Agggah ! ''####[]
None Does the positivist argument seem persuasive ?####[]
None It has always amused me that the core injunction of the logical positivists , ``only those statements that are empirically verifiable are meaningful , '' is itself not empirically verifiable .####[]
None One is reminded of something about hoisting and petards .####[]
None John Rawls of Harvard has argued eloquently that our human notions of fairness derive from what we would all ``contractually '' agree to , were we to know before birth that we would all be born with diering abilities and endowments .####[]
None Thus ``equality before the law '' is one contract that Rawls commends to us .####[]
None `` Equality before the law '' is far more refined than the yuck or yum of the bacterium .####[]
None The emergence of ethics in the evolution of life on this planet is a fascinating issue .####[]
None I will content myself with wondering where ``value '' and the rudiments of ``intentionality '' come from in the physical universe in the first place and leave social contracts for other eorts .####[]
None Where is the place of value in a world of fact ?####[]
None So , a short soliloquy .####[]
None Facts are know - that statements .####[]
None But know - how preceded know that .####[]
None While fully aware of Hume ' s injunction , I think that from the autonomous agent ' s perspective , yuck or yum is primary , unavoidable , and of the deepest importance to that agent .####[]
None I suppose we apply the Darwinian criteria .####[]
None Too much yuck , this one and its progeny are gone from the future of the biosphere .####[]
None Without attributing consciousness to an E. coli , or an autonomous agent we may create in the near future , I cannot help but feel that the rudiments of value are present once autonomous agents are around .####[([0, 21], [25, 26], [21], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None And again without attributing consciousness , once an autonomous agent is around is the rudiment of intentionality present ?####[]
None If so , another cornerstone of ethical activity has been laid .####[]
None Ethical behavior requires first the logical possibility of behavior for which one is responsible .####[]
None You are not responsible for acts and eects beyond your control .####[]
None To act ethically , you must first be able to act at all .####[]
None But what are ``acts '' in the first place ?####[]
None Daniel Yamins is a brilliant young mathematician .####[]
None Now entering Harvard , Dan spent a summer with me at the Santa Fe Institute before he learned to drive , after an earlier summer spent in the laboratory of Jack Szostak at Harvard , where , at age fourteen , Dan was learning to evolve RNA molecules to bind arbitrary ligands .####[]
None Dan and I struggled that summer to make the distinction between the ``doings '' of an autonomous agent and mere happenings in and around the autonomous agent .####[]
None Note we say the E. coli is swimming upstream in the glucose gradient to get dinner .####[]
None But all sorts of molecular vibrational , rotational , and translational motions are occurring .####[]
None What are actions and what are mere happenings ?####[]
None I do not think we were successful in drawing a clean distinction between doings and happenings with clear mathematics .####[]
None But I sense that the distinction between doings and happenings , Dan ' s happy phrasing , is relevant for E. coli , tigers , us , trees , and autonomous agents in general .####[]
None We will meet a similar problem in the next chapter when we attempt to distinguish between the function of a part of an organism and the other causal consequences of that part of the organism .####[]
None Strange and interesting , is it not , that these issues all seem to arise with autonomous agents but not otherwise ?####[]
None Granted that we here seem to confront the language game circularity alluded to earlier , yet I do truly think that the rudiments of semantics , intentionality , value , and ethics arise with autonomous agents .####[([21, 37], [20, 21], [18], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None I do not think those rudiments suce to jump over Hume ' s naturalistic fallacy .####[([5, 16], [4], [2], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None We cannot deduce ought from is in any concrete context , but I think we have the categories of ought and is in the physical universe once we have autonomous agents .####[([0], [14, 15], [13], 'Neutral', 'Average')]

None Bank said a plan to sell its South Carolina branch offices to First Citizens Bank , of Columbia , S.C. , fell through .####[]
None Poughkeepsie also expects to post a one-time charge of $ 8.3 million , resulting in a net loss for the third quarter .####[]
None The charge represents a write-down of the goodwill associated with Poughkeepsie 's investment in the banks it is trying to sell and its North Carolina branches as well .####[]

None After their withdrawal from Bethlehem , Bayt Jala , and Qalqilya , the Israeli forces withdrew from Ramallah yesterday , but they maintained the siege and closure around the city .####[]
None This means that the suffering of the citizens in Ramallah , like the suffering of the citizens in Bethlehem , Bayt Jala , and Qalqilya , will continue on the roadblocks , affecting their medical , economic , educational , and social life .####[]
None No other people in the world have seen such suffering .####[]
None The main and perhaps only reason for this suffering is the continuing Israeli occupation and its heavy burden on Palestinian citizens .####[]
None The Israeli withdrawal was a correction of a mistake the Israeli Government made when it decided to reoccupy parts of the main West Bank cities following the assassination of Israeli minister Rehav'am Ze'evi .####[]
None The reoccupation was a kind of collective punishment for the inhabitants of those cities and the villages around them , villages that constitute an organic and vital extension of the cities .####[]
None The Israeli forces destroyed buildings and installations in those cities , arrested dozens of citizens , and killed dozens others .####[]
None That showed that the ruling right-wing coalition in Israel is pursuing an occupational policy and is not , in the first place , willing to recognize the firm national Palestinian rights to freedom , independence , and the end of occupation and settlement .####[]
None This policy , which disregards the need to establish a just peace based on the need for the Palestinian people to regain their freedom and independence , is reflected in statements made by the Israeli officials , who brag about the large number of Palestinians who were killed or arrested by the Israeli forces .####[]
None It is also reflected in the fact that the ruling Israeli coalition has no agreed -upon political plan and that the settlement plans and initiatives that are attributed to this Israeli official or that are unable to meet the minimum legitimate Palestinian demands .####[([0], [42, 44], [41, 42], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None These initiatives and plans largely try to keep as much hegemony and as many settlements as possible on Palestinian lands , resources , airspace , and crossing points .####[]
None In its approach to the national Palestinian rights the Israeli Government is playing the cat and mouse game .####[]
None It is trying to use the time factor to perpetuate the occupation .####[]
None It is also working to push the Palestinians and the world into new labyrinths and tunnels , inside the old tunnels , to distract them from the main and central demands .####[]
None The cycle of reoccupation - withdrawal - reoccupation is part of this approach , which is no secret to anyone .####[]
None The only way to peace lies in the full Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian territories that were occupied in 1967 and the termination of the occupational and settlement presence in these territories .####[]
None The way to peace does not lie in devious methods to circumvent the inalienable Palestinian rights .####[]
None Such methods would only complicate things and add fuel to the raging fire .####[]

None Costello , like many Gitmo types , is baffled at the uproar over the prisoners ' treatment .####[([14, 18], [11, 13], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None " Soldiers and Marines that are guarding the detainees at Camp X - Ray have worse conditions than the detainees , " he says .####[]
None Much has been made over their being kept in outdoor cells , invariably called " cages , " which are topped with corrugated tin-covered wooden roofs that keep what little rain Gitmo gets ( six inches a year ) off the prisoners .####[]
None Costello says their eight- by- eight cells contain about twice as much space as soldiers have in their crowded , unventilated tents a few hundred yards away .####[]

None ( One of the medics treating detainees claims that a full quarter of them were suffering from malnutrition when they were captured . )####[]
None But we do n't have to take Costello 's word for it .####[]
None We can see for ourselves , sort of .####[]
None After a quick stop at McDonald 's ( the only one in Cuba ) , our white school bus transports us past beautiful seaside vistas and brownish cactus-infested scrub , past ramshackle housing and up a hill , which features an abandoned auto yard that the locals used to call Sears .####[]
None It 's where they 'd strip old junkers for parts then used on jerry - rigged jalopies called " Gitmo specials . "####[]
None Across from Sears is Camp X - Ray , a teeming hive of concertina wire , canvas tents , guard towers , and newly constructed plywood interrogation shacks with window - unit air conditioners .####[]
None The chain- link cells themselves do n't need air conditioning , since a comfortable Caribbean breeze ( temperatures range from the low 70s at night to the low 80s during the day ) continuously circulates through the encampment .####[]
None Restricted to an area about 150 yards away from the open-air cellblocks , we observe the camp from a slight elevation that CNN 's John Zarrella calls " Heartbreak Ridge , " so named " because if you 're a journalist , it breaks your heart that you ca n't get closer .

None Likewise , when thousands of Cuban rafters were detained here for months in the mid-' 90s , many grew so unhappy with Gitmo 's ghostly desolation that they 'd do anything to leave , including inject diesel fuel into their veins , drive tent stakes into their limbs , even swim back to Castro 's Cuba .####[([23, 24], [19, 22], [18, 19], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None By comparison , the al Qaedans look pretty fat , if not happy .####[]
None They laze away in the shade of their cells .####[]
None They sleep on inch-and - a- half - thick isomats , the same ones that are issued to our military .####[]
None With the assistance of a Muslim Navy chaplain , they pray five times daily .####[]
None ( Quick studies , the al Qaedans did n't need arrows painted on their cell floors .####[]
None A single signpost next to an American flag points the way to Mecca . )####[]
None And while American prisoners in the Hanoi Hilton often spent years in solitary confinement and received no medical care ( John McCain to this day ca n't comb his own hair ) , X - Ray detainees get daily sick calls from all manner of doctors , from optometrists to podiatrists .####[]
None The prisoners ( who represent about 25 different nationalities but mostly are Saudis ) can also freely chat with each other about God knows what : prison uprisings , the demise of Talk magazine , trades of Froot Loops for garlic bagel chips .####[]
None Their restroom arrangements are pretty spartan .####[]
None They get a white bucket for emergency squirts , while they are instructed to hold two fingers up for the alternative .####[]
None At that time , a guard shackles them and takes them to the port-o- loo .####[]
None While the military has spared no expense in construction costs ( in three weeks , they built a completely operational field hospital staffed by 160 medical personnel -- two more than there are prisoners ) , they 've saved a fortune in toilet paper .####[]
None It 's the detainees ' cultural preference not to use any .####[([8, 12], [5, 8], [3, 5], 'Positive', 'Weak')]
None " We do n't shake their hands , " says one camp guard .####[]
None In addition to the aforementioned amenities , detainees also receive two towels , a Koran , a shortened toothbrush ( still long enough to file into a shiv ) , a canteen , a bucket of water , fluoride toothpaste , and shampoo .####[]
None Not just any shampoo , but " Lively " salon anti-dandruff shampoo -- a " luxurious shampoo in a gentle formula that restores moisture , shine , and body to your beautifully clean hair . "####[]
None Those who think the prisoners are getting coddled ( Rep.####[]
None John Mica , a Florida Republican , visited the camp and said it 's " too good for the bastards " ) will be happy to know that the shampoo is not jojoba-enriched .####[([29, 34], [23, 28], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]

None When I skirt away from my minders and visit the Marine snipers ' tent , I learn it went well beyond that .####[]
None The snipers , of course , are the camp 's deadliest sharpshooters , ropy young bucks ( 21 - 23 years of age ) who seem largely culled from the western or southern United States , where firearms are often regarded as extra appendages .####[]
None Their tent looks like a Marines - issued college dorm room :####[]
None Skoal - juice bottles , laundry hanging everywhere , and a spade- like sniper insignia banner tacked to a tent wall .####[]
None If there is a prison uprising , it is these gentleman who will man the guard towers and introduce the rioters to their 72 black - eyed virgins .####[]
None At some point , that might become necessary , they tell me , as plotting is obviously afoot .####[]
None Sgt. Matt Lampert of Montana says the other day one of the prisoners was caught " with a piece of cloth stuffed with rocks that was tied off at the end . "####[]
None Sgt. Rodney####[]
None Davis says that during chowtime , he sees them through his scope " making terrain models out of their food . "####[]
None And unlike say , Afghan prisons , where starving detainees are reportedly begging to be sent to Gitmo , there 's plenty of food to play with .####[([15, 19], [12, 14], [0], 'Neutral', 'Strong')]
None " They get fed better than us , sir , " says Lampert .####[]
None When I ask the Marines if they 've seen anything weird , they laugh sheepishly , looking at each other .####[]
None Finally , Sgt. Josh Westbrook , who sports a forearm tattoo of flaming baby heads , steps up .####[]
None " They know they 're being watched , " he explains , " so they 'll stare at you , and while they stare at you , they 'll , uh , masturbate . "####[]
None According to these Marines , they do n't just pleasure themselves to freak out the snipers , but also to embarrass the female Army guards in the camp 's interior .####[]
None The weirdness does n't end there .####[]
None They 've also eaten their toiletries and urinated on equipment .####[]
None " The other day , " says Westbrook , " one of the guys tried to do a naked cartwheel . "####[]
None In the most bizarre twist , Lance Corporal Devin Klebaur says a few have also been known to " put toothpaste in their ass . "####[]
None " What 's the purpose ? "####[]
None I ask .####[]
None " I 'm not sure , " he says , puzzled .####[]
None After leaving the snipers , I collar other grunts who say they believe the prisoners are more apt to act out whenever they see one of the regular visitors from the International Committee of the Red Cross enter the camp .####[]
None " They 're looking to be disciplined , " says one , so that any aggressive guard behavior will make it look as if they 're being brutalized by the American military in front of international witnesses .####[]
None ICRC visits , says another soldier , are the highlight of a prisoner 's day , since they 've been spotted " giving the unshackled prisoners cookies and milk , cigarettes , shaking their hands . "####[]
None Many organizations who have n't been to Gitmo , like Human Rights Watch , have been extremely critical of the prisoners ' treatment , while the ICRC has aired no complaints .####[([20, 24], [28, 32], [26, 28], 'Neutral', 'Weak'), ([20, 24], [15, 19], [1, 14], 'Negative', 'Strong')]

None We see them offering them cookies , hugging them like they 're best buddies .####[([9, 10], [7, 9], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None They 're undermining everything we 're trying to do . "####[]
None What we 're trying to do is n't exactly clear at this point .####[]
None We are certainly interrogating the prisoners , though base sources wo n't divulge any information that 's been gleaned .####[]
None The prisoners will likely be formally charged and tried , though when I called a senior Pentagon source to find out by whom and when , the source said , " If you find out , will you please tell me ? "####[]
None ON SUNDAY , Rumsfeld visits , and we hope for illumination .####[([10, 12], [9, 10], [8, 9], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None Sitting on a bus on the tarmac , waiting for the secretary to emerge from his plane , we pass the time as journalists do , discussing the AP - style spelling of " bin Laden , " speculating whether the prisoners will get an Internet cafe ( one of them has asked for video games ) , and making fun of the fresh-meat Pentagon press corps , who are overdressed in heavy wools instead of our much cooler island linens .####[([63, 68], [59, 63], [19, 20], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None One of Rumsfeld 's security agents mounts our bus , telling us the ground rules : no photos on the tarmac , no fighting , no hitting Rumsfeld in the head with a boom mike .####[]
None After Rumsfeld tours Camp X - Ray with four senators and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Richard Myers ( who is so overshadowed by the secretary 's rock star aura that one reporter has to ask who he is ) , Rumsfeld meets the press on Heartbreak Ridge .####[]
None He gives the sort of hooah performance that has endeared him to both the troops and the press .####[([11, 12], [9, 12], [13, 19], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None While he remains as firm as ever that the detainees are " illegal combatants , " not " prisoners of war , " which would afford them more rights under the Geneva Convention , he nicely avoids plucking the only hair worth splitting -- whether the captives ' status is his call .####[]
None ( Human rights hawks say the matter should be decided by a " competent tribunal , " whatever that is . )####[]
None Even if it is n't up to Rumsfeld , the argument seems rather academic .####[]
None It 's hard to imagine anyone who has actually read the Geneva Convention wanting to confer POW status on alleged al Qaeda members .####[([15, 24], [13, 15], [5, 13], 'Positive', 'Weak')]
None Doing so would not only make the terrorists eligible for repatriation to their home countries , but also would forbid their being punished for trying to escape , allow them to receive " scientific equipment " from home , and even confer upon them the right to dentures -- in case they lost their teeth while , say , biting a guard .####[]
None Most ludicrous , they would be afforded " advances of pay " in an amount " never ... inferior " to that which we pay our own armed forces .####[]
None If you 're a terrorist from Central Asia , it 's not a bad deal : Kill Americans , get arrested , then get a pay raise from America .####[]
None With all the global bellyaching about the detainees ' right to humane treatment , it 's hard to imagine them getting better treatment than they 're already receiving .####[([7, 15], [4, 5], [3, 4], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None On my last day at Gitmo , all I have time to eat is a stale Ding Dong and a greasy plate of onion rings .####[]
None My public affairs keepers could n't care less .####[([0], [5, 9], [1, 4], 'Negative', 'Weak')]
None By contrast , for breakfast and lunch alone , the prisoners are served oatmeal , an orange , peanut butter , margarine , a " culturally appropriate " halal meal , and a giant snack pack containing Froot Loops , raisins , a Nature Valley granola bar , baked garlic bagel chips , and Bullseye barbecue -seasoned sunflower kernels .####[]
None Still , the overseers of the prison are concerned that detainees are n't getting enough pita bread with their meals , and they 're planning to make the food spicier , just the way the prisoners like it back home .####[([28, 31], [37, 38], [35, 37], 'Positive', 'Weak'), ([10, 21], [8, 10], [3, 8], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None While we wait , we journalists have to stand in the hot sun most of the day .####[]
None After hours , we are confined to our Consolidated Bachelor Quarters , sleeping four to a duplex room on cots , some without pillows or blankets .####[]
None We are n't even allowed to go the beach , a few hundred yards away from our building ( though , emboldened by the rum we imported from Puerto Rico , a colleague and I make a mad dash under a guard searchlight for the bathwater Caribbean anyway ) .####[]
None Besides drinking , our only entertainment is a pool table -- one cue is cracked , the other is missing its tip .####[]
None The prisoners , by contrast , get to read their Korans , while novels and more " religious books " are on the way .####[]
None At the end of their day , they get a good night 's sleep in a single cell .####[]
None At the end of our day , we are told that a C-141 ( the same plane that transported the detainees ) just became available , and we are prematurely hustled off so the military can dump us in Nowheresville , New Jersey , on a Sunday night after every rental car place in the state has closed .####[]
None Perhaps the international community is right .####[]
None The treatment being meted out at Guantanamo is inhumane .####[]

None Billions of investors ' dollars are pouring out of the nation 's junk - bond mutual funds , undermining a pillar of support in the already reeling junk market .####[]
None Last week alone , an eye-popping $ 1.6 billion flowed out of the junk funds , or nearly 5 % of their total assets , according to estimates by Dalbar Financial Services Inc. , a Boston research firm .####[]
None In the past two months the nation 's 88 junk funds have lost a total of about $ 6 billion -- more than 15 % of assets -- through sales or transfers of junk - fund shares , Dalbar says .####[]
None It made the estimates based on data collected from more than a dozen big junk funds .####[]
None Interviews with three major fund groups -- Fidelity Investments , Vanguard Group Inc. and T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. -- confirm the trend .####[]
None Their junk funds combined have had net outflows totaling nearly $ 500 million , or about 13 % of their junk fund assets , in the past two months .####[]
None Some fund managers say negative publicity has exacerbated investors ' concern about recent declines in junk - bond prices .####[([12, 20], [10, 11], [1, 4], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None " People have been seeing headline after headline after headline and saying : ` I ca n't take it anymore -- I 'm getting out , ' " says Kurt Brouwer of Brouwer & Janachowski , a San Francisco investment adviser .####[]
None The withdrawals could spell trouble for the $ 200 billion junk market .####[]
None If the heavy outflows continue , fund managers will face increasing pressure to sell off some of their junk to pay departing investors in the weeks ahead .####[]
None Such selling could erode prices of high- yield junk bonds , already weakened by a rash of corporate credit problems .####[]
None Mutual fund groups have n't lost control of much of the outgoing money , says Louis Harvey , Dalbar 's president .####[]
None Mutual fund officials say that investors have transferred most of it into their money market accounts , and to a lesser extent , government - bond funds .####[]
None So the impact on the $ 950 billion mutual fund industry as a whole probably will be slight .####[]
None But tremors are likely in the junk- bond market , which has helped to finance the takeover boom of recent years .####[]
None Mutual funds are the among the largest holders of junk , accounting for more than a quarter of the entire high - yield , high- risk market .####[]
None The 88 mutual funds investing solely in junk bonds hold assets of about $ 32 billion .####[]
None Other funds hold a smattering of junk bonds , too .####[]
None The $ 1.5 billion Fidelity High Income Fund has had a net outflow of about $ 150 million in the past two months .####[]
None About $ 60 million streamed out last week alone , double the level of the week following last month 's Campeau Corp .####[]
None credit squeeze .####[]
None About 98 % of the outflow was transferred to other Fidelity funds , says Neal Litvack , a Fidelity vice president , marketing , with most going into money market funds .####[]
None " You get a news item , it hits , you have strong redemptions that day and for two days following -- then go back to normal , " says Mr. Litvack .####[]
None The fund , with a cash cushion of more than 10 % , has " met all the redemptions without having to sell one thing , " Mr. Litvack says .####[]
None He adds : " Our fund has had { positive } net sales every month for the last three years -- until this month . "####[]
None Vanguard 's $ 1 billion High Yield Bond Portfolio has seen $ 161 million flow out since early September ; $ 14 million of that seeped out Friday Oct. 13 alone .####[]
None Still , two -thirds of the outflow has been steered into other Vanguard portfolios , says Brian Mattes , a vice president .####[]
None The fund now holds a cash position of about 15 % .####[]
None At the $ 932 million T. Rowe Price High Yield Fund , investors yanked out about $ 182 million in the past two months .####[]
None Those withdrawals , most of which were transferred to other T. Rowe Price funds , followed little change in the fund 's sales picture this year through August .####[]
None " The last two months have been the whole ball game , " says Steven Norwitz , a vice president .####[]
None Junk - fund holders have barely broken even this year , as fat interest payments barely managed to offset declining prices .####[]
None Through Oct. 19 , high- yield funds had an average 0.85 % total return ( the price change plus dividends on fund shares ) , according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc .####[]
None That 's even less than the 4.35 % total return of the Merrill Lynch High - Yield Index .####[]
None Fidelity 's junk fund has fallen 2.08 % this year through Oct. 19 , Lipper says ; the Vanguard fund rose 1.84 % ; and the T. Rowe Price fund edged up 0.66 % .####[]
None People who remain in junk funds now could get hit again , some analysts and fund specialists say .####[]
None Many funds in recent weeks and months have been selling their highest - quality junk issues , such as RJR Nabisco , to raise cash to meet expected redemptions .####[]
None Funds might be forced to accept lower prices if they expand their selling to the securities of less-creditworthy borrowers .####[]
None And then , asset values of the funds could plunge more than they have so far .####[]

None " I have n't found a single scrap of any kind of information that suggests that anyone has been treated anything other than humanely . "####[]
None Mr. Rumsfeld spoke in an unusual briefing that stretched over an hour in an attempt , he said , to " tap down some of this hyperbole . "####[]
None It was prompted by a rising tide of international criticism after the Defense Department released photographs over the weekend that showed some of the prisoners kneeling before their captors , their legs in shackles , their hands bound in manacles , their mouths covered by surgical masks and their eyes blinded by large goggles with black tape .####[([12, 14], [5, 10], [8, 9], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None His comments came as criticism swelled from abroad .####[([0], [4, 7], [7, 9], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None Critics said the United States was using sensory deprivation and other psychological control techniques to weaken the prisoners so that interrogations would be more fruitful .####[]
None The International Committee of the Red Cross , in a rare break with its code of not publicly criticizing detaining governments , said the United States might have violated Geneva Convention rules against making a spectacle of prisoners by distributing the pictures , which were published worldwide .####[([33, 39], [32, 33], [1, 9], 'Negative', 'Weak')]
None Amnesty International sought access to the prisoners in Guantanamo and said they should be allowed to have lawyers .####[([3, 10], [2, 3], [0, 2], 'Positive', 'Weak')]

None Several governments joined the chorus , saying the prisoners should be granted prisoner of war status under the Geneva Convention .####[]
None Such status would accord them the highest level of protections .####[]

None Terry Carrico , said he was determined at all times to maintain what he called " positive control " over the prisoners .####[]
None Bill Nash , a retired Army major general and senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations , said this amounted to " imposing on them a psychological sense of isolation , domination and futility , and trying to establish the conditions by which you can then reward them for information , as oppose to punish them .

None But he argued that whenever prisoners , especially those who are dangerous and suicidal , are transported , it only makes sense to lock them in restraints .####[]
None " When they are being moved from place to place , will they be restrained in a way so that they are less likely to be able to kill an American soldier ?####[]
None You bet .####[]
None Is it inhumane to do that ?####[]
None No .####[]
None Would it be stupid to do anything else ?####[]
None Yes . "####[]
None It is not clear why the United States has not officially designated the detainees as prisoners of war , especially since Mr. Rumsfeld said they are essentially being treated as such .####[]
None " They 're in legal limbo , " said Michael F. Noone , professor of military law at Catholic University .####[]
None " The United States has to get moving on screening these people and determining whether or not they 're P.O.W.'s .####[]
None There is no explanation for the delay . "####[]
None Mr. Rumsfeld said the Pentagon 's clear priority with the prisoners was to extract information from them to prevent future attacks .####[]
None " These people are committed terrorists , " he said .####[]
None " We are keeping them off the street and out of the airlines and out of nuclear power plants and out of ports across this country and across other countries . "####[]
None And yet , officials at Guantanamo have said that no interrogation has taken place on the base and that the prisoners do not have lawyers .####[]
None Asked what benefit the United States gets by not classifying the captives as prisoners of war , Mr. Rumsfeld said , " I do n't know enough of the legal technicalities to answer your question .####[]
None I know that the process of gathering the intelligence information has not been concluded . "####[]
None Mr. Rumsfeld said one of the complicating factors was that the Geneva Conventions give protection to prisoners from countries but not from terrorist organizations , like Al Qaeda , to which some of the prisoners apparently belong .####[]
None " To give standing under a Geneva Convention to a terrorist organization that 's not a country is something that I think some of the lawyers who did not drop out of law school as I did worry about as a precedent , " he said .####[([2, 18], [38, 41], [45, 46], 'Negative', 'Average')]

None The highway to the stars is looking radiant for the Belgian " cosmonaut . "####[]
None The formal agreement regarding Frank De Winne 's flight with the Russians was signed in Brussels on Thursday by Charles Picque , the Minister for Science Policy , and his government commissioner Yvan Ylieff .####[]
None The document , a letter sent to both the ESA ( European Space Agency , to which Frank De Winne currently reports ) and the Russian Rosaviacosmos space agency , guaranteed the payment by Belgium of the expenses tied to this space trip .####[]
None So on 4 November 2002 , that is to say , in a little less than one year , the second Belgian to reach space will take off from the Baikonor cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on board a brand new Soyuz space ship : the TMA -1 .####[]
None It is a ship that is more modern and bigger than the current Soyuzes .####[]
None On it Frank De Winne will serve as the on-board engineer .####[]
None So he will be the second most qualified crew member on board , behind the on-board comander , who still needs to be appointed by the Russian space authorities .####[]
None This appointment is not expected for a few weeks .####[]
None So , if that should prove necessary , De Winne will be able to personally pilot the space ship .####[]
None This is a first on a " TMA , " which attests to the confidence the Russian and European partners have put in him .####[([0, 1], [14, 16], [16, 21], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None An example ?####[]
None In Brussels on Wednesday [ 28 November ] , the French astronaut Claudie Haignere , who had just completed a flight in space together with the Russians that in every way was identical to the one scheduled for De Winne , could not find enough praise for our fellow citizen , with whom she trained for several months in Moscow .####[([48, 51], [42, 47], [12, 15], 'Positive', 'Strong')]

None Some Particularly Financial Choices####[]
None As is known , Frank De Winne 's taxi flight lasting about 10 days comes with a price tax : some 600 million [ Belgian ] francs ( 15.5 million euros ) .####[]

None An initial segment of 2.5 million euros ( Frank 's training costs ) will reportedly be paid in the next few days .####[]
None Several avenues have been explored to collect the overall amount .####[]
None The latest , and also undoubtedly the most logical , is internal to the SSTC , the federal Scientific , Technical , and Cultural Services , which , in particular , manage the country 's space budgets .####[]
None The sum in question will come from the SSTC 's space budgets and be deducted in several years ( two or three ) .####[]
None The SSTC 's overall budget will not suffer from this .####[]
None Nor will the space sector 's in particular .####[]
None Cancellation Insurance####[]
None " Budgets will remain constant , " explained Eric Beka , the SSTC 's secretary general .####[]
None The sums obtained will result from the assignment of a portion of the space budget to this mission ( and its many related scientific fall-outs ) rather than to other optional programs .####[]
None In a word , De Winne 's ticket into space has been financed .####[]
None And his " parachute " too .####[]
None " Since there is no other Belgian astronaut at the ESA who is capable of replacing Frank De Winne for this mission if it suddenly proved impossible for him to carry it out , we are also expecting to take out ' travel insurance ' for our ' cosmonaut , ' " Yvan Ylieff also said .####[]
None " This should insure that we can recover the sums involved , that in the prospect of another space trip . "####[]
None One million euros will be devoted to this " cancellation " insurance .####[]
None About 10 years ago , Dirk Frimout was the first Belgian astronaut to go into earth orbit .####[]
None That was with the US Atlantis shuttle .####[]
None In a few weeks the second Belgian to go up there will don a Russian cosmonaut 's space suit .####[]
None It will be a mission that will be rich in promises .####[]
None De Winne will thus qualify technically in space piloting .####[]
None He will become one of the best elements in the corps of European astronauts .####[]
None In addition , he will carry the projects of Belgian scientists and industrialists active in the space sector far .####[]
None As Picque emphasized , " for many years , each franc invested by Belgium in space has brought in three francs . "####[([10, 17], [2, 5], [1, 2], 'Neutral', 'Weak')]

None This year , the US report devotes many pages to commenting on human rights in the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea and Iraq .####[]
None The US judgment of the practice of human rights depends on US interests as well .####[]
None The British News Agency Reuters remarked that in the 2000 human rights report , the United States criticized Egypt for trying suspected terrorists in military courts .####[([19, 20], [17, 18], [1, 5], 'Negative', 'Average')]

None In Venezuela , the dust is finally settling after the dramatic turbulence of the past two weeks .####[]
None President Hugo Chavez is once again at the helm of power , and the military has returned to its barracks .####[]
None But there are many grieving Venezuelans who are n't quite at peace .####[([0], [4, 5], [4, 7], 'Negative', 'Strong'), ([0], [8, 13], [4, 7], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None Their loved ones were gunned down , first by sympathizers of Mr. Chavez and subsequently by supporters of the short-lived interim government .####[]

None A probe of what transpired should be in the offing .####[]
None Mr. Chavez has placed his cronies in every democratic institution , from congress to the courts , and is expected to prevent any honest inquiry .####[]
None So far , Mr. Chavez appears complicit in the initial wave of killings .####[]
None According to taped radio conversations broadcast yesterday in Venezuela on radio and television , Mr. Chavez ordered tanks and troops to surround the presidential palace , as unarmed civilian protesters marched against him on April 11 .####[([33, 34], [30, 33], [3, 5], 'Negative', 'Strong')]

None Mr. Cardoso 's concerns are quite valid , but he has downplayed some of Mr. Chavez 's more alarming faults .####[([0], [3, 5], [1, 3], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None The Venezuelan leader has struck friendships with Cuban , Libyan and Iraqi leaders with great fanfare , and his open defiance of U.S. interests has wooed Venezuelans wary of U.S. power .####[([23, 25], [20, 22], [1, 4], 'Negative', 'Strong'), ([19, 25], [26], [26, 28], 'Positive', 'Weak'), ([8, 14], [4, 7], [1, 4], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([30, 32], [28, 30], [26, 28], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None Indeed , after all the muscle-flexing , Mr. Chavez has little to offer the Venezuelan people .####[]
None He has choked off foreign investment by doubling the royalty payments oil companies must pay to the government and by restricting corporate ownership on some oil projects to 49 percent .####[]
None He has also alienated workers at his country 's state-owned oil company , Petroleos de Venezuela , by replacing long-serving professionals with his supporters .####[([1, 2], [3, 4], [4, 6], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None In fact , Mr. Chavez consolidated his power by rewriting the country 's constitution in 1999 .####[]
None Interestingly , Mr. Chavez initially rose to power in the 1990s because of the discontent with former President Carlos Andres Perez , who had ordered the military to shoot at crowds in 1989 .####[([16, 22], [14, 16], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]

None Following Iran 's proposal on cutting off the supply of oil to countries that support Israel for one month , which was supported by some oil-exporting countries , there was an increasing probability that Venezuela would also support [ the proposal ] .####[([12, 17], [3, 5], [2, 3], 'Neutral', 'Average'), ([3, 20], [22, 24], [25, 28], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([15, 17], [14, 15], [2, 3], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([15, 17], [36, 39], [34, 35], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([40, 43], [36, 39], [34, 35], 'Positive', 'Average')]

None When the U.S. brings Afghan detainees to Guantanamo Bay####[]
None By Michael Elliott####[]
None It 's not going to be a country club , " said Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld last week , describing the new military detention camp at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , and nobody ever expected it would be .####[]
None The 110 al - Qaeda and Taliban prisoners admitted to " Gitmo " by the end of last week are , said Rumsfeld , " the hardest of the hard core , " men who had killed " dozens and dozens of people . "####[]
None But though it may lack tennis courts and a putting green , the amenities are better than you 'd find in a cave at Tora Bora .####[]
None True , prisoners are now confined to 6 - ft. by 8 - ft. chain - link enclosures with concrete floors and tin roofs ( Rumsfeld thinks it 's " pejorative " to call them cages ) .####[([34, 38], [26, 28], [25, 26], 'Negative', 'Weak')]
None But relief will come ; in three months , the Pentagon hopes to replace the facility with something more permanent .####[([13, 21], [12, 13], [10, 11], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None In the meantime , the prisoners at Camp X - Ray -- as the place has been called since the early 1990s when it housed Haitian refugees -- have been given thin green mats and blankets on which to sleep and pray , and are allowed to shower and exercise .####[]
None They are provided with a medical exam upon admission , and their diet ( is someone making a point about diversity here ? ) ranges from bagels and cream cheese to rice and beans -- all eaten with plastic utensils -- after which the prisoners may clean their teeth with specially shortened brushes .####[]
None ( The caution makes sense ; in 2000 Mamdouh Salim , an al - Qaeda operative awaiting trial in New York City for his part in the 1998 embassy bombings , used a comb to stab a prison guard through the eye . )####[]
None So far , humanitarian groups have been muted in their criticism of the conditions at Guantanamo .####[]
None Last week a delegation from the International Committee of the Red Cross arrived to inspect the camp and offer private recommendations on its operation .####[]
None But in the European press , the prisoners ' lot has become a public issue of contention among those who demand that U.S. conduct be above suspicion .####[([23, 28], [20, 22], [19, 20], 'Neutral', 'Strong')]
None Three detainees are said to have claimed to be British citizens .####[]
None Politicians and commentators in London are now clamoring that all held in Gitmo must be guaranteed treatment in accordance with international law .####[]
None The Daily Telegraph , a paper usually so conservative that it makes Pat Buchanan look vegetarian , warned Washington of the need to draw a " distinction between civilized society and the apocalyptic savagery of those who would destroy it . "####[([36, 42], [17, 18], [1, 5], 'Negative', 'Average'), ([18, 20], [17, 18], [1, 5], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None At the heart of the matter is a question of legality .####[]
None The Pentagon has resisted calling the detainees prisoners of war , preferring the terms unlawful combatants or battlefield detainees .####[([13, 20], [11, 13], [1, 3], 'Positive', 'Weak')]
None It 's easy to see why .####[]
None Under the Geneva Convention , those holding true POWs are bound to release them at the end of hostilities ; but that is the last thing the U.S. wants to do with men who may be al - Qaeda operatives .####[([1, 20], [29, 30], [27, 28], 'Negative', 'Average'), ([31, 32], [29, 30], [27, 28], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None Moreover , by convention ( though the law seems to be murky here ) POWs do n't need to tell their captors anything other than their name , rank , serial number and birthday .####[]
None But for Washington , the whole point of the detention is to conduct interrogations and thus head off new acts of terrorism .####[]
None The Geneva Convention does contemplate that some irregular forces captured in battle need not be considered POWs .####[]
None That may well apply to members of al - Qaeda , a free-floating band of terrorists .####[]
None But not all of those at Gitmo are al - Qaeda men .####[]
None Some -- the Pentagon wo n't say how many -- were members of the Taliban and presumably thought they were part of the Afghan army .####[]
None Are they POWs ?####[]
None Washington says no , because the Taliban had no clear chain of command and was not a legitimate government .####[]
None That may be so ; unfortunately , as Amnesty International has pointed out , under the Geneva Convention the Pentagon has no business making such a determination .####[]
None Those who fall into the enemy 's hands are entitled to POW status until a " competent tribunal " has determined their status .####[]
None In the case of those in Cuba , that has n't happened .####[]
None More curious still is the matter of the prisoners ' ultimate fate .####[]
None Rumsfeld has laid out four options : a military trial , a trial in U.S. criminal courts , return to their home countries for prosecution , or continued detention " while additional intelligence is gathered . "####[]
None The last seems a distinct possibility ; the Pentagon plans to build 2,000 cells at Camp X - Ray .####[]
None " This will be a big deal down there for at least two years , guaranteed , " says Army Lieut .####[]
None General B.B. Bell , who commands Fort Hood , Texas , the base from which military police have been deployed to Cuba .####[]
None But it 's hard to find a justification for such detention in the Geneva Convention or anywhere else .####[]
None Leaving the prisoners " indefinitely beyond the reach of any legal regime , " said the Economist last week , " would put America -- pre-eminently a nation of laws -- itself outside the law . "####[]
None Until the Pentagon sorts out the legal issues , criticism from Europe is likely to grow .####[([2, 3], [9, 11], [11, 13], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None Still , things could be worse .####[]
None The prisoners may be in Cuba , but nobody has yet forced them to listen to Fidel Castro 's long -winded speeches .####[]

None The recent settlement of details regarding the Kyoto Protocol is putting local exporters on alert .####[]
None The Kyoto Protocol was made by members of the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change at its seventh session held in Marrakech , Morocco at the start of the month .####[]
None If the protocol , which prescribes an obligatory reduction of greenhouse gases , is put into effect , the nation 's export will be heavily damaged .####[]
None The Kyoto Protocol is an agreement to get 30 leading industrialized countries such as Japan and members of the European Union ( EU ) to lessen greenhouse gas emissions by amounts as high as 95 percent of levels in the 1990 's .####[]
None The government and business circle expect the nation 's exports to be damaged in direct and indirect ways from 2008 , when advanced nations will begin to be regulated by the protocol .####[]
None The reason is that South Korea 's industrial structure depends heavily on the export of products including not only durable appliances such as air conditioner but also automobiles all of which should meet intensified environmental standards before they can be shipped overseas under the Protocol .####[]
None Also , advanced nations are likely to make use of the standards as a new trade barrier .####[]
None Moreover , the pressures from advanced countries to get South Korea to cut its greenhouse gas emissions is expected to strengthen .####[([8, 18], [3, 5], [5, 8], 'Neutral', 'Weak')]
None South Korea ranked ninth on a list of the largest greenhouse gas producers , and Korea 's per-capita emissions were also close to those of advanced countries .####[]
None Under this situation , the nation cannot possibly avoid pressures to match the cuts of advanced nations .####[([12, 18], [9, 11], [0], 'Neutral', 'Weak')]
None In particular , Japan and European countries are likely to persuade developing countries including South Korea to take part in the reduction of greenhouse gases earlier than planned in an attempt to secure the United States ' ratification of the protocol .####[([11, 29], [10, 11], [4, 8], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None The U.S. backed out of the agreement , saying its industries would be handicapped by stringent rules that developing countries could simply ignore .####[([6, 8], [2, 5], [1, 2], 'Negative', 'Weak')]
None Even though South Korea declared its intention to discuss its duty to cut down greenhouse gases from 2018 , there is little possibility that advanced nations will wait until then .####[]
None If things go on like this , the government must transform the current industrial structure into an environment - friendly one and minimize industries which use a host of energy such as petrochemicals and cement manufacturing .####[]
None The government will have to pour a lot of money into businesses to promote energy efficiency .####[]
None According to an April survey of 416 firms across the country conducted by the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( KCCI ) , 60 percent of total respondents said the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change will greatly influence local firms####[]
None But only 28.4 percent replied that they are rushing to conform to the protocol 's requirements .####[]
None " The government should provide domestic firms real aid like tax reductions and environmental technology development rather than abstractly recommend domestic firms promote energy efficiency and lower energy consumption , " an industry source said .####[([20, 31], [18, 20], [32, 35], 'Positive', 'Weak')]

None THE ABDUCTION of a French diplomat 's wife on Thursday has introduced a political dimension to the kidnap- for-ransom pestilence that has spread dramatically during the past 10 months .####[]
None The kidnap gang freed her and her driver within two hours of seizure .####[]
None No ransom was paid .####[]
None The abduction , however , delivered a more devastating blow on the capacity of the Macapagal administration to crack down on kidnap syndicates than the grim statistics trotted out by Teresita Ang - See , the Chinese -Filipino anti-crime " crusader , " who has relished the role of Cassandra to the Philippine National Police under the new administration .####[([47, 60], [45, 47], [30, 35], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None Since 1992 when organized crime became a leading preoccupation in the national agenda , the main victims of the predatory syndicates have been Ang - See 's compatriots in the Chinese -Filipino community .####[]
None The conventional explanation is that because of their wealth , they are the logical prey from which to extract ransom money -- a perverse form of nationalist racism and redistribution of national wealth .####[]
None The Abu Sayyaf kidnapping of foreigners in Sipadan , Malaysia , and in Dos Palmas , Palawan , broke this ethnicity pattern .####[]
None But the seizure of the diplomat 's wife and her driver was the first time in 10 years that the gangs struck at members of the diplomatic community , whose immunity has been somehow respected by organized syndicates .####[([30, 32], [32, 36], [36, 39], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None The seizure sent alarm bells ringing in the diplomatic community in this country .####[([1, 3], [3, 7], [8, 11], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None The repercussions in the home governments and countries are as damaging as the prolonged hostage -taking by the Abu Sayyaf of French , German , Malaysian , Lebanese and Finnish nationals during the Estrada administration .####[]
None Then President Joseph Estrada had to cancel visits to Paris and other European capitals in 2000 after he was told that he would receive a hostile reception from the European public over the lengthy impasse of negotiations for the hostages ' release .####[([33, 43], [25, 28], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None From my own sources in the diplomatic community , as well as in the Philippine National Police , the diplomat 's wife and her driver went to the French school in Bicutan at around 10 a.m. , in response to a call from school authorities who reported that her son had some accident .####[]
None On the way , a group of about six armed men in uniforms blocked her brand- new car ( which had no diplomatic plate ) at Better Living Subdivision , Paranaque , and boarded it .####[]
None The gang drove the car around the vicinity while they interrogated the victims for about two hours .####[]
None The hijackers asked them for money -- one million pesos was mentioned -- which she had supposedly withdrawn from the bank .####[]
None She told them she had not withdrawn such money and that she was the wife of a senior French diplomat .####[]
None The gunmen let her go .####[]
None The PNP , which believes it was a case of mistaken identity , could not explain why it took the gang two hours to know the identity of the lady .####[]
None After detaining them for about two hours , they drove her and the driver to a squatters ' area and dropped them off near the Bicutan exit , but not before they took her necklace and wallet .####[]
None They did not take her ring and other pieces of jewelry .####[]
None The gang fled with the car , and the victims took a tricycle home .####[]
None The details of the crime and the swift release are less important than the political implications .####[]
None Whether the incident was plain holdup , as the PNP would like to see it , the abduction reinforced the growing perception in the diplomatic community and foreign governments that there is a breakdown in law and order and that the Macapagal administration is not in control .####[([2, 16], [11, 13], [9, 10], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([41, 44], [20, 23], [24, 30], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None This perception is also fueled by the crime statistics of Ang - See , who represents the pessimistic outlook in contrast to the more dismissive outlook of the PNP whose statistics are less alarming than those of Ang - See .####[([0], [15, 20], [12, 14], 'Negative', 'Average'), ([0], [23, 27], [28, 29], 'Neutral', 'Weak')]
None While Ang - See 's statistics , derived mainly from non-official sources , paint a grim picture , they should not be ignored .####[]
None At the same time , the PNP ca n't be burying its head in the sand and offering explanations all the time , rather than check the rise of kidnappings .####[]
None Ang - See 's close collaboration with former PNP chief , now Sen. Panfilo Lacson , is an open secret .####[]
None Some administration officials wonder whether she paints doomsday scenarios just to embarrass the administration and to portray the contrast in performance between the PNP under Lacson and the current PNP leadership , which has no love lost with Lacson .####[([38, 40], [34, 38], [1, 3], 'Negative', 'Strong'), ([0], [6, 10], [1, 3], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None Since the members of the diplomatic community had previously been immune from the predatory attacks of the gang , the abduction of the diplomat 's wife naturally has generated anxieties among foreign governments about how safe their diplomats are in this country .####[([35, 43], [28, 30], [31, 33], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None There is a strong perception in the diplomatic community that the abduction was a fake kidnap - for - ransom and was a political act to demonstrate the administration 's incapacity to put crime under control .####[([28, 30], [3, 6], [7, 10], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None The reasoning behind this perception is that if the gangs were after ransom money , it did not matter whether their victims belonged to the diplomatic community .####[]
None The perception is that there was a political message in the abductions staged by some groups that are determined to make this government fail .####[([22, 24], [18, 20], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None A number of embassies here , including the American , French , German and Japanese , have issued advisories to their nationals warning them of risks when travelling in some parts of the country .####[([26, 35], [17, 20], [1, 16], 'Negative', 'Weak'), ([26, 35], [22, 24], [1, 16], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None The advisories have been prompted by domestic lawlessness and political turbulence rather than by a possible outbreak of insidious terrorist attacks associated with al - Qaida and Osama bin Laden and provoked by the American military action in Afghanistan .####[([0], [1, 3], [0], 'Negative', 'Weak')]
None At the rate syndicates are abducting targets -- regardless of their ethnic identity and their diplomatic status -- with impunity , the administration faces a more serious and direct challenge to its capacity to govern from the specter of lawlessness than from the daunting problem of sparking an economic recovery amid the global economic downturn .####[]
None We do n't need al - Qaida terrorist attacks in this country to bring the government down in turmoil , create uncertainties in the business community , and frighten tourists and investors away .####[]
None The diplomatic community 's perception of President Macapagal is that she is organized , knows her economics , does her homework , and has been unscathed by scandals that have been rubbed on her skin by a scandal - mongering opposition .####[([6, 9], [4, 6], [1, 4], 'Positive', 'Weak')]
None But the downside is that the deterioration of peace and order is her nemesis that is undoing all her diplomatic initiatives in the world stage to project the Philippines as a staunch ally in the US - led coalition in the war on international terrorism .####[([35, 46], [31, 34], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]

None Norway and the other rich countries have a moral responsibility to achieve real reductions .####[]
None Regardless of what Norway and other countries manage to do in this respect , we must prepare ourselves for climate changes .####[]
None According to the United Nations ' climate panel , in the next 10 to 20 years changes in the climate will be almost unaffected by what we do in the way of initiatives in the next few years to reduce emissions of climate gases .####[]
None The explanation is that the increased concentration of climate gases in the atmosphere and the slowness of the climate system will make a certain degree of global warming unavoidable .####[]
None In recent years the RegClim research project , under the aegis of the Norwegian Research Council , has worked to estimate the way the climate will develop in Norway in 30 to 50 years .####[]

None For the next few years our goal is to both gain more knowledge and put together good preparedness strategies .####[]
None All the world 's countries and peoples are affected by climate changes but it is the poor countries that are being hit the hardest .####[]
None Even if developing countries have contributed to these climate problems to just a slight degree , they will nevertheless bear the greatest burden .####[]
None Norway and other industrialized countries , on the other hand , have fairly good prospects of grappling with climate changes because we have an economy to put necessary measures to work .####[]

None There exists the potential for significant reductions in climate gas emissions in Norway that will not produced with today 's resources .####[]
None The use of quotas will be a cost-effective means of achieving better results .####[]
None A quota is a right to emit a certain quantity of climate gases during a certain period and this right can be sold on a market .####[]
None The advantages are that the authorities can set a ceiling on all emissions .####[]
None Businesses that are obligated by a quota can then choose whether they want to buy those quotas they need or introduce measures to reduce emissions .####[([15, 26], [13, 14], [0, 8], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None Many countries , among them Denmark , Great Britain , and Sweden , are already under way developing early quota systems .####[]
None In addition to being effective , an early quota system would also give business and industry useful experience before the international quota system following the Kyoto Protocol comes into effect in 2008 .####[]
None In the government 's work to put the quota system into shape in Norway , we are now discussing a number of problems .####[]
None Some of these are :####[]
None The range- which gases and sectors should be included in the quota system , and how businesses exposed to competition should be dealt with .####[]
None Measures about emissions - how much all of those obligated by a quota can emit .####[]
None Fines for exceeding the quota limit .####[]
None The possibility of cooperating with other countries ' early quota systems .####[]
None I am pleased that there now seems to be broad political consensus that in Norway as well we should get under way with an early quota system .####[([5, 28], [2, 4], [2], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None Regardless of the shape of the measures in Norway , Norwegian businesses as well ought to contribute to reducing emissions in poor countries .####[]

None Apart from criticizing the " axis of evil " countries for abusing human rights , it also listed abuses in several countries that are members of the anti-terrorist alliance .####[([5, 11], [2, 4], [16, 17], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None What is most interesting about the reports is the section on Israel .####[]
None Since Israel suffers from terrorist attacks , the report says , it has been forced to take counter-terrorism measures , making its rights abuses understandable .####[]
None What 's more , post - Sept. 11 restrictions in the US on entering and leaving the country and on air travel , as well as measures curbing the civil rights of accused persons , are not discussed at all .####[]
None The report is generally quite frank and its wording strong , but it proposes no corrective action .####[]
None Consolidating the anti-terrorist alliance and expanding the war against terror are overshadowing concerns about human rights .####[([15, 17], [12, 13], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None In exchange for support for its war on terror , the US is tacitly agreeing to ignore abuses by other members of the anti-terror coalition .####[([6, 10], [3, 6], [20, 26], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None The most glaring examples are Russia 's suppression of resis-tance to its rule in Chechnya , China 's suppression of independence advocates in Xinjiang and the Falun Gong movement , and Israel 's treatment of Palestinians .####[]
None US activities , meanwhile , show no sign of promoting the universal values of democracy , human rights and peace .####[]
None Six months have passed since Sept. 11 and the focus of US anger has turned to countries that have been labeled " rogue nations " and members of an " axis of evil . "####[([16, 18], [19, 22], [12], 'Neutral', 'Weak'), ([16, 18], [13, 14], [12], 'Negative', 'Average')]

None The human rights report poses a substantial challenge to the US interpretation of good and evil .####[]
None Put simply , what we are seeing is the naked pursuit of US interests .####[]
None No one who has ever studied realist political science will find this surprising .####[]
None To earn legitimacy , however , US interests must be made to appear just .####[]
None Even though almost all military mobilizations in history have been motivated by notions of good versus evil or of orthodoxy versus unorthodoxy , efforts to present the naked pursuit of US interests as a battle of good versus evil reflect a lack of understanding and tolerance .####[]
None Demonizing the enemy will guarantee that peace will not be gained through war .####[]

None To prove that human rights are important ammunition in the battle against terror , then , the US must attack terrorism to make human rights matter to these countries .####[([24, 25], [25, 27], [28, 30], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None If , however , US President George W. Bush still believes in the supremacy of human rights , he must not forget the breeding ground for terrorists that exists within the anti-terrorist alliance .####[([13, 19], [10, 12], [5, 9], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None The US is planning to extend military aid to several countries in the alliance to enable them to root out terrorists without using US forces .####[]
None Such wishful thinking risks making the US an accomplice in the destruction of human rights .####[]
None If the US , which claims to be the world 's policeman , is incapable of looking beyond US interests or of practicing the universal values of human rights , democracy and peace , then should n't the international community reconsider the role played by the UN , or learn from the way the European parliament works ?####[]

None The real victor in this battle is , in fact , the Palestinian people and not the Zionists .####[]
None For many reasons , the occupation of Palestinian towns cannot last , so the Zionist forces will have to withdraw from these towns sooner or later .####[]
None In addition , it is now more impossible than ever to control the movement of three million Palestinians .####[]
None This is actually one of the deep-rooted facts .####[]
None As for the towns and refugee camps that have been destroyed , they will soon be reconstructed by the Palestinian people who have skillfully adapted themselves to the most difficult circumstances .####[]
None This reconstruction will take place more quickly than what the criminals in Tel Aviv and Washington think .####[]
None Most importantly , however , these criminals will have the largest illusion if they imagine that they have succeeded in liquidating the intifadah and destroying its infrastructure after having succeeded in liquidating or arresting a small or large number of the intifadah 's leaders and strugglers .####[([22, 24], [14, 16], [14], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None Another deep-rooted fact is that the organizations of the Palestinian resistance still preserve their organizational structure and are also characterized by their superb ability to renew their leaders and replace the ones who fall along the path of martyrdom .####[]
None These criminals know this fact , as much as we , the Arabs , do , because they are in direct contact with it .####[]
None As for the intifadah 's infrastructure , it has actually widened and turned into volcanoes that are boiling with rage .####[]

None NASA blamed the problem on weightlessness .####[]
None Engineers suspect the one- ton car floated ever so slightly off the rail , causing the magnetic sensors on the bottom of the car to lose contact with a pair of iron strips in the aluminum tracks .####[]
None The railcar will eventually be used during the next stages of the space station 's construction .####[]
None The track runs along a 44 - foot girder that space shuttle Atlantis ' astronauts delivered and bolted to the orbiting outpost last week .####[]
None The problem cropped up after the empty flatcar moved down 17 feet of track at a snail 's pace of less than a half - inch per second .####[]
None Right on cue , the car stopped at a work station and was automatically latching itself down when everything came to a halt .####[]
None Ground controllers took over manual control and , a few hours later , were able to latch the railcar to the track .####[]
None Space station astronaut Carl Walz sent another computer command from inside to get the railcar moving again .####[]

None A Brief History Jerusalem ' s recorded history begins with its mention in Egyptian court records 4,000 years ago , but there had been human settlements here for centuries , probably millennia , before that .####[]
None At the beginning of the second millennium b.c. , Jerusalem was a Canaanite mountain stronghold on a secondary trade route , far less important than biblical cities such as Hazor , Megiddo , Beth Shean , and Shechem .####[]
None The earliest name associated with the city , Ur usalim , perhaps meant ``city of Shalim ' ' or ``founded by Shalim .####[]

None But with his death the empire collapsed , and the Israelite kingdom was divided into two separate , impoverished , often warring nations : Israel , with its capital at Shechem in the north , ruled by a series of northern dynasties ; and the smaller kingdom of Judah , with its capital at Jerusalem , from which the Davidic dynasty continued to rule .####[]
