NA To Caruana , Argentina has to " create a broad program that generates internal and external stability and discuss it with the IMF . "####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA The Bank of Spain Governor did not want to detail what points Argentina should deal with to expand its program .####[([9, 20], [6, 8], [1, 5], 'Negative', 'Weak')]

NA Malan noted that as part of the constructive engagement in relation to Argentina , a group of experts spent the day with authorities from that country , recounting their experiences in situations like the one the Argentines are facing .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA In the group were former Bank of Mexico Governor Miguel Mancera , who dealt with the peso crisis in 1995 ; a former Chilean Central Bank president who faced the 1982 crisis , when the Chilean GDP dropped by 14 percent ; former IMF Fiscal Affairs Director Vito Tanzi ; an expert in restructuring the Spanish debt ; and former Brazilian Central Bank President Gustavo Loyola , who lived through the time of the Collor government 's withholdings and of the Proer [ Program to Encourage the Reorganization and Strengthening of the National Financial System ] - the program to restructure the Brazilian banking system .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

"####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA " We do not want to yield on Brazil 's having its own currency , its regional currency .####[([6, 14], [3, 5], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]

"####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA According to Malan , the dollarization process is irreversible .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA The Minister believes that tension between Brazil and Argentina , resulting from the floating of the real in 1999 , will tend to disappear because the neighboring country is opting for a floating exchange rate system .####[([32, 36], [29, 30], [1, 2], 'Neutral', 'Weak'), ([9], [5, 6], [1, 2], 'Negative', 'Weak'), ([7], [5, 6], [1, 2], 'Negative', 'Weak')]

NA To Malan , however , more important than the harmonization of the parameters and the little Maastricht is the search for convergence of policies in a broader sense - structural , macro and microeconomic ones .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA The Finance Minister says he hopes , for Mercosur , something similar to what happened in the EU : " an ability to look decades ahead and not let oneself get beaten down , like in some countries that dedicate themselves to lamenting , that see the difficulties as being insurmountable , and the problems as being unsolvable .

NA But we would , uh , buy , lollipops is what they call them now , but we called them suckers and we would get often a 2 - cent sucker .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Are you making fun ?####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA No , I love this story .####[([5, 6], [4], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
NA And the 2 - cent suckers is what is referred to now as a Tootsie Roll Pop .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA And we called them 2 - cent suckers because every other sucker cost a penny .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Except these were 2 cents because they had the Tootsie Roll in the middle .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA And there was one other sucker that cost a nickel and we called that an all day sucker , just because you could n't eat the whole thing for the entire movie and you would really just have that sucker all day long .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA And one other form of refreshment that we got , which really embarrassed my mother because she did n't know anything about this until she went with us to the movie one Saturday , there was a bakery next door to the movie theatre .####[([11], [12, 13], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
NA And my brothers and myself were not the only people that did this ; all the kids that would go to the movie knew to do this .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA We would go into the bakery and we would ask for -####[([0], [10, 11], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
NA - a nickel worth of scraps !####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA And we did n't even have to ask for it because the bakery lady knew us and she knew to have all this ready for all the kids going to the movie .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA And what it was it was broken cookies and broken pieces of whatever happened while they were baking , mistakes .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA So they would fill little bags for us and we would give them a nickel and we could take that to the movie theatre with us .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA And that 's all the stories I can remember about the movies right now .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I do know that I did used to go the movie downtown at the Carolina Theatre .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA And when I was young , it was n't a strange thing for the kids to just go off and go to a movie .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I mean , my mother knew where we were going and she knew when we would get back , but today you would n't send your seven or eight year old child to a movie theatre alone even if they were with their nine year old brother ; you just would n't do it .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA And we could skate to the movie or ride a bicycle to the movie and we would do that .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Which is kind of sad that you ca n't do that anymore and it 's not just because things are , there 're bad people in the world but it 's too much traffic .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA You have to check everything about a movie , check it out to see what the content is and just was n't like that when I was growing up .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Also about that same time period in my life , I guess again between seven and ten years old , which seems to be what I remember most vividly , my best friend uh , was Kathy Josey , and she was a next door neighbor also , and we remained friends up until , uh , she was about 35 and she passed away with cancer .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA But we , we remained close friends .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA In fact we shared an apartment , first apartment either one of us ever had .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA And when we were , um , little girls we used to play " Career Girls " !####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA We did !####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA And we used to try to dress up and pretend we were businesswomen .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA And we would go to work and pretend we had an apartment together and then when we grew up , we sure did ; we got an apartment .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Uh- huh .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Um , Kathy and I also used to play other kind of dress ups and it just , it seems like , I remember we both had like our mother 's long skirts , or the skirts would be long on us and we would literally wear dress up clothes that belonged to our mothers .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA But we had , Kathy had one pair of pearls or beads of some sort of necklace that was her mother 's and I did n't have the necklace .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA And it was really beautiful and I really , really wanted one .####[([12], [8, 11], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
NA So we only had the one necklace and we , er , we decided , I do n't know if it was jointly or if Kathy was just extremely nice of whatever , but she said I could wear it part of the time .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA And we would literally time the amount of time , we wore it like 30 minutes or 15 minutes or whatever .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA And the way we decided who got to wear it first , and this always kind of bothered me because I know Kathy did this intentionally , she said the youngest one got to wear it first and she was like six months younger than I am .####[([14], [15, 18], [0], 'Negative', 'Weak')]
NA So , it , that became a normal thing with us .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Whenever we only had one of something she would always say , " Well , I think the youngest one gets to do it , or wear it or whatever first . "####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA And , that just always stuck in my mind , that in , in our adult life I brought that up to her and she sort of acted like she did n't know anything about that and I thought to myself , " she does , " and then she laughed about it and she realized that she had kinda held a trump card on that one .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Um , also we did a lot of pretending and as I said we played career girls and the dress ups .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA And my sister and I used to pretend also and Jill is about 2 years younger than I am , maybe two and a half , and we used to play Robin Hood except we did n't have a Maid Marion , we had a Saretha , I do n't know where in the world that name came from .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA But we would switch playing Robin Hood , one would play Robin Hood and one would play Saretha .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA And Saretha was the counter , would be the same thing as Maid Marion , and , why , again , I do n't know why we did n't use Maid Marion .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA But in my mind I can remember playing that , like all day long .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA And we would go over to my grandparents ' and they had a a big white house with a big front porch and , uh , banisters on it and a lot of rocking chairs out on the front porch .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA And it was just a great place to pretend and we would climb up on the porch and on the banisters and we could make those our horses or , uh , it could be a castle ; just do many things with it .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Um , and when we were still living in High Point in our back yard we had a huge , I do n't know , I guess it was an oak tree , but it was a really big tree , but it was a climbable tree .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA And it had real large , thick branches extending out to the side and they were fat enough branches where as a child of eight and nine years old we could straddle the branches .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA And that was another game that Jill and I used to play ; we would pretend we were in the jungle and we would climb up on the tree and we would straddle the tree branches and pretend it was our elephant .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA And in the yard , we had an old tree that had been cut down and just the stump was remaining and my mother had planted , um , flowers all around that stump and we would use that stump as a , as a throne and the princess got to sit up on that stump on that throne and have all those flowers around her and that would be the throne and she would be the queen or the princess or whatever .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA When I was a teenager , an Audrey Hepburn movie came out called Wait Until Dark .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA And I think I was probably 16 or 17 years old ; we were of driving age .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA And I had a group of girlfriends that I ran around with and there were , golly , there might 've been 8 to 10 of us who were good friends .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Everybody had their own " best " friend but then we had one big group that we used to do a lot of things together .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Um , and we would , had that many girls but we would only go out in a couple of cars and I remember one of the girls , Betty Belle , her dad had a VW Beetle , and we 'd fit like 5 girls in that VW Beetle .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Did Betty Belle turn Catholic ?####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA She didn't ?####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA No .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA So we went out one night to the movie , but before we went to the movie we went to get pizza and then we went to , and I think the name of the place was The Open Kitchen , and we did n't have chain pizza places like we do now , like Pizza Hut and all that .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA This was just a really neat pizza place that all the kids would go .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA And we went to Open Kitchen and we would have eight or 10 girls and we would order one pizza and all share it and everyone would only get one piece and I think we would make the waitresses mad because we did n't have money to leave tips .####[([35], [37, 40], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
NA We would also drink water .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA So it was n't a good situation for the waitresses , but we had fun and we did n't even think about it .####[([0], [14, 15], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
NA We just did what we could get away with .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Anyway , that night we were gonna go see Wait Until Dark and I think it was on at the Manor Theatre , and I just remember when you have like 10 or so girls going somewhere to the same place it 's kind of a , pretty much of a spectacle ; we 're all in this long line and we 're giggling and laughing and cutting up and having really a great time .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA This was , uh , a real intense , um , drama and , just very scary ; kept you on the edge of your seat .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA And there was a scene in the movie I remember where every one of us , and it was n't just our group , but so many people in the theatre , they screamed out at one time .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA And that 's really all I remember about that night , it was just a lot of fun .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA At our instigation , on 4 March EU environment ministers therefore called on the United States to " assume its responsibilities under the framework agreement on climate change , " that is to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels and strengthen domestic actions to bring them into line with the level of effort accepted by the industrial countries in application of the Kyoto Protocol .####[([14, 28], [12, 13], [8, 10], 'Neutral', 'Weak')]

NA But autonomous agents , we who do daily manipulate the world on our own behalf , we to whom ``intentionality '' and ``purpose '' are so inevitably attributed by our common languages , we are , by my definition of autonomous agents , also nothing but physical systems with a peculiar organization of processes and properties .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA If the concept of autonomous agents were something like a useful or more , a proper definition of life itself , then autonomous agents span the gap from the merely physical to that new realm of the merely physical where ``purpose ' ' is ascribed by all of us to one another .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA I hope my definition of an autonomous agent is useful , an autocatalytic system carrying out a work cycle , now rather broadened by the realization that autonomous agents also do often detect and measure and record displacements of external systems from equilibrium that can be used to extract work , then do extract work , propagating work and constraint construction , from their environment .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA Once there is an autonomous agent , there is a semantics from its privileged point of view .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA The incoming molecule is ``yuck '' or ``yum . ''####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I think the major conceptual step to yuck or yum is unavoidable once there is an autonomous agent .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA Consider first the famous genetic code .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Triplets of nucleotides in an RNA molecule stand for specific amino acids that will end up incorporated into a protein .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA The detailed causal machinery involves transfer RNA molecules with their anticodon site and the distant site to which amino acids are attached , the aminoacyle transferase enzymes that charge the amino acid binding site of each transfer RNA with the proper amino acid among the twenty amino acids , the binding of the charged transfer RNA ' s anticodon site to the proper RNA code word triplet , the ribosome that glides between adjacent charged transfer RNA molecules and links the successive amino acids into the growing polypeptide chain that hangs free in the cytoplasm , tethered by the ribosome to the messenger RNA molecule as it is ``translated .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA The arbitrariness of the genetic code is exemplified by the evolution of novel transfer RNA molecules , which translate a given messenger RNA code word triplet into a dierent amino acid .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA As J. Monod properly emphasized three decades ago in a slightly dierent context concerning activation and inhibition of enzymes at allosteric sites on the enzyme that are distant from the catalytic site , the relation of chemical structures that achieve control of catalysis are utterly arbitrary with respect to the chemical structures that undergo the catalysis .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA The same is true of the transfer RNA where the anticodon site is distant from the amino acid binding site .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Because of this , which amino acid is charged onto a particular transfer RNA is utterly arbitrary and controlled by the aminoacyle transferase enzyme that does the charging , plus the structure of the amino acid binding site on the transfer RNA .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Both of these can be altered without altering the anticodon-codon matching mechanism .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA In short , chemistry allows arbitrary organizations of control relations .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA It seems fully legitimate to assign the concepts of sign , signified , and significans to the genetic code .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA It seems legitimate to extend that notion to much of the subtle signaling , chemical and otherwise , within and between autonomous agents , as exemplified by plants that upon infestation by a particular insect secrete a secondary metabolite chemical that ``warns ' ' other members of the same species that an insect infestation is happening and to turn on defensive anti-insect secondary metabolites .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA The calculus that is Claude Shannon ' s elegant information theory has always been about reduction of uncertainty about the statistics of the source of a set of symbols .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Nowhere in the core of Shannon ' s work concerning the encoding and transmission of information does the meaning , or semantics , of the information enter .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA This is no criticism , and is widely known and appreciated .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA There is , however , just a hint of semantics in Shannon ' s view that the semantics resides in the ``decoder . ''####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I cannot buy Shannon ' s view unless the decoder is an autonomous agent .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA If not , then the decoder merely transforms a bit string sent along a communication channel into some other discrete or continuous dynamics perhaps a set of water - filled bowls is drained by turning on a machine that opens valves between the bowls and to the outside world in particular ways .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA The patterns of bowl drainage upon receipt of the binary string messages sent along the communication channel constitutes the decoding .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA But if the recipient is an autonomous agent such as a bacterium and the incoming molecule is a symbol-sign of a paramecium or an amoeba on the roam and the bacterium swims away and avoids becoming dinner , that sequence of events seems laden with semantics .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA But patience .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Not only are we unable to prestate the configuration space of a biosphere and predict what will unfold , but we also cannot even translate in the sense of necessary and sucient conditions from legal talk to normal intentional talk , let alone from legal talk of Henderson found guilty of murder to a physical talk about sound -wave forms monitored and masses at space - time lines as a description .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Then let ' s just be naive for the moment .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA It seems hard to ascribe purpose , in the sense of acting on its own behalf , to a stone or a chair and easy with respect to an alga .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Of course , there is a sense in which my attribution of semantics to autonomous agents is purely tautological .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA After all , I began by stating that a bacterium swimming upstream in the glucose gradient was acting on its own behalf in an environment , defined an autonomous agent as a physical system able to act on its own behalf , then asked what a physical system must be such that it can act on its own behalf .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Now , five chapters later , it is hardly an independent deduction that autonomous agents are the proposed organization of matter , energy , and organization to which purposes can be ascribed in the sense of being able to act on their own behalf .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA My definition is a definitional circle .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA On the other hand , while the definition is circular , like F = MA and Darwin ' s ``natural selection '' and ``fitness , '' that does not mean that the set of codefined concepts surrounding my definition of an autonomous agent as a reproducing system that does a work cycle fails to touch the real world .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA Watch a pair of nesting birds build their nest .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA Knowing####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA What about ``knowing '' ? Daniel Dennett , in his fine book Darwin ' s Dangerous Idea , advances a hierarchy of forms of ``knowing , '' if I may use that term , that have arisen in evolution by Darwinian means .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I find his hierarchy congenial and informative .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Dennett envisions evolution as a sequence of kinds of construction cranes that bit by bit build up higher - order entities via variation and natural selection .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I do not disagree , although I have placed far greater emphasis on the roles of self-organization in evolution .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Here , in Investigations , I am trying to point at the mysterious but utterly natural hopefulness in which an increasing diversity of broken symmetries in the universe creates the diversity of structures and processes that can constitute and identify ramified and ramifying sources of energy , detect those sources of energy , create devices and processes that couple to those sources of energy , and generate yet more diversity that propagates macroscopic order even further .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I wonder , in short , at the naturalness and self- generaticity of Dennett ' s cranes building cranes building cranes in biospheres , perhaps planetary geologies , and beyond .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA But back to the past .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Dennett distinguishes ` `Darwinian creatures , '' ` `Pavlovian creatures , '' ` `Popperian creatures , '' and ``Gregorian creatures . ''####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA A simple autonomous agent , say , a bacterium , is a Darwinian creature .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA In its simplest version , the creature evolves by mutation , also recombination and natural selection .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA For the moment , no behavioral learning is to be considered .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA So one ( or a colony or an ecosystem ) of Darwinian creatures adapts more or less as Darwin told us .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA At the next level up , say , aplysia , a nervous system is present , and the creature is capable of stimulus - response learning , a la Pavlov .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Indeed , aplysia can learn very simple conditioned stimuli the later analogue is the bell causing the dog to salivate in ``expectation '' of food .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA At the next level ( Dennett , perhaps properly , reserves this for us vertebrates ) is the Popperian creature .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Popperian creatures , in Dennett ' s fine phrase , have ``internal models '' of their world and can ``run the internal model ' ' with the clutch disengaged , rather than running the model in real time in the real world .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA This allows us lucky Popperian creatures to allow our ``hypotheses to die in our stead . ''####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I love that image .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Beyond the Popperian is the Gregorian creature namely , at least humans .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA Without invoking consciousness , not because it is not worth invoking but because so little sensible has ever been said on the subject , it seems worth asking how much of this hierarchy could be realized by simple molecular systems , even without evoking nerve cells .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I would think a lot of this hierarchy could find molecular realizations .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA For example , bacteria and amoebae do have a kind of Pavlovian learning already , for they have receptors that accommodate to a constant level of a given signal ligand and sense instead a change from the current level .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA This is not yet the association of a more or less arbitrary conditioned stimulus with an unconditioned stimulus , but I can imagine chemistry to accomplish the latter .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA As neurons are supposed to proliferate and form novel synaptic connections that survive if used and to mediate the linkage of conditioned to unconditioned stimulus , why not envision a complex chemistry , say , very complex carbohydrate -synthesis patterns sustained by complex sets of enzymes whose activities are modulated by the dierent carbohydrates themselves , which is true of contemporary carbohydrate metabolism .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Such a system might blindly try out variant patterns of synthesis until it could establish a self-sustaining web linking the carbohydrates , the enzymes , and certain protein receptors mediating the linkage between unconditioned and conditioned stimulus , then maintain that linkage by positive feedback loops .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA The image is not too far from how it is imagined that ``idiotype ' ' and ``anti-idiotype '' immune networks work to sustain synthesis of a set of desired antibodies against an incoming pathogen .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA In such networks , for which there is modestly good evidence , a given first antibody serves as an antigen that stimulates the body to produce a second antibody that binds to the unique amino acid sequences , called the ``idiotype ' ' of the first antibody .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA In turn , the second ``anti-idiotype ' ' antibody stimulates a third , which stimulates a fourth .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA But this series is likely to form feedback loops because the first and third antibody can often both bind to the same site on the second antibody , hence , the first and third antibodies are similar shapes in shape space .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
