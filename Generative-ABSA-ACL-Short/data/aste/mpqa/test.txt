None Copithorne , who has served in the UN post since 1995 , through his Iran reports to the UN Commission on Human Rights ( UNCHR ) , whose 53 member states open an annual six-week session on March 18 , has clearly shown that he is under the strong influence of Zionist circles and Washington 's biased attitude towards the Islamic Republic .####[([60, 63], [57, 58], [54, 56], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None The UN rapporteur 's new report on Iran , which he submitted to the commission on Friday , includes nothing new .####[]

None Interestingly , although Copithorne has not visited Iran since 1996 , he continues to submit his Iran reports to the UN Commission on Human Rights without having any knowledge of the realities in the Islamic Republic .####[]

None Another round of talks will be held today between Powell and the chief players in the Middle East .####[]
None But the current development of events , that is , the standstill situation , makes it clear that US foreign policy has been put to a very serious test in which the United States needs to discipline its decades - long ally , Israel , and not ruin its relations with the Arabs .####[]
None The impression is that , under US sponsorship , the international community deliberated too long about the violence in the Middle East .####[([7, 9], [1, 3], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]

None Powell 's words , " we are working on this plan , " are unclear , because he did not say what the plan is , and Israel 's call for a conference on the Middle East is also unclear .####[([32, 38], [30, 32], [27, 29], 'Positive', 'Weak')]
None In relation to the first ambiguity , Powell 's words definitely cannot be taken seriously , considering that precisely Washington is the one that has been practicing a one-sided approach to the events in the Middle East for 18 months now and it was the chief opponent of the positioning of peace troops between the two warring sides .####[([49, 59], [46, 49], [19, 21], 'Negative', 'Average')]

None The international community received a lot of negative points for the Middle East .####[]

None Europe does not have a united stance on the violence in Ramallah , Nablus , Bethlehem , and the Palestinian refugee camps , despite the clear situation that Israel is the only country in the world that secures its borders by occupying territories of another state .####[]
None The EU 's efforts and US President Bush 's peace initiative through Secretary of State Powell seem like a late resolution , considering that approximately one month ago the Arab countries participating in the summit in Beirut held out an olive branch to Israel through the plan of Saudi Arabia 's heir to the throne , Prince Abdullah , which contained two points : recognition of a Palestinian state [ as published ] in an Arab neighborhood , in return for recognition of the Palestinians ' right to their own country .####[([43, 44], [38, 43], [30, 38], 'Positive', 'Average')]

None The candy businesses had sales of about $ 154 million last year , which was roughly 12 % of total revenue for RJR 's Planters LifeSavers unit , according to a memorandum distributed by RJR 's owner , Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. , to bankers last December .####[]
None The Nestle acquisition includes a candy plant in Franklin Park , Ill. , which employs about 800 workers .####[]
None The sale , which had been expected , is part of KKR 's program to pay down $ 5 billion of a $ 6 billion bridge loan by February .####[]
None Roughly $ 2 billion of that debt has already been repaid from previous asset sales , and RJR expects to use another $ 2 billion from the pending , two - part sale of most of its Del Monte unit .####[]
None That sale , however , could still fall through if financing problems develop .####[]
None Thus , it remains crucial for RJR to obtain top dollar for its smaller assets like the candy brands .####[]
None Louis Gerstner Jr. , chairman and chief executive officer of New York - based RJR , called the sale a " significant step " in the company 's divestiture program , as well as a " a strategic divestiture . "####[]
None Since KKR bought RJR in February for $ 25 billion of debt , it has agreed to sell nearly $ 5 billion of RJR assets .####[]
None RJR 's executives have said they will dispense with certain brands , in particular , that are n't leaders in their markets .####[]
None " RJR Nabisco and Planters LifeSavers will concentrate more on our own core businesses , " Mr. Gerstner said Friday .####[]
None Baby Ruth and Butterfinger are both among the top-selling 15 chocolate bars in the U.S. , but RJR 's overall share of the roughly $ 5.1 billion market is less than 5 % .####[]
None Nestle 's share of 7 % before Friday 's purchases is far below the shares of market leaders Hershey Foods Corp. and Mars Inc. , which have about 40 % and 36 % of the market , respectively .####[]
None " This means Nestle is now in the candybar business in a big way , " said Lisbeth Echeandia , publisher of Orlando , Fla. - based Confectioner Magazine .####[]
None " For them , it makes all kinds of sense .####[]
None They 've been given a mandate from Switzerland " to expand their U.S. chocolate operations .####[]
None Nestle S.A. is based in Vevey , Switzerland .####[]

None Although he refused to make a final judgement on the conduct of the weekend presidential poll , he told parliament that if Mugabe was declared the winner of a rigged vote , it would have " enormous implications " for London 's ties with Harare .####[]
None " If it becomes clear , and the evidence is already pretty strong , that President Mugabe , in the event he is declared the winner , has stolen the election , then that has enormous implications for the nature of our relationship with Zimbabwe , " he warned .####[]

None Mugabe was to be inaugurated again as Zimbabwean president on Sunday following his controversial re-election last weekend .####[]
None He was first elected Prime Minister in 1980 and has effectively ruled the country ever since .####[]
None Mbeki , Obasanjo and Howard have been mandated by the recent Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting ( CHOGM ) in Australia to decide what action should be taken on the situation in Zimbabwe .####[([22, 34], [6, 9], [10, 22], 'Neutral', 'Strong')]
None Their decision would be based on the Commonwealth observer team 's report on the legitimacy of the election as well as those prepared by the Southern African Development Community , the Organisation of African Unity and the SA Observer Mission .####[]
None The Commonwealth team earlier this week said that " the conditions in Zimbabwe did not adequately allow the free and fair expression of will by the electorate " .####[([0], [21, 25], [1, 3], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None The SADC on Saturday endorsed the vote , despite its Parliamentary Forum , which judging that the March 9 - 11 election " did not conform with the norms and standards of the SADC Parliamentary Forum , " signed on to by Zimbabwe .####[([6, 8], [4, 6], [1, 3], 'Positive', 'Average')]

None Mbeki was , however , already on the record as saying that the Commonwealth also had other issues to consider .####[]
None CHOGM had also decided to look at ways of helping Zimbabwe with land reform and food aid .####[]
None State-sanctioned land invasions , several times declared illegal by Zimbabwe 's courts , as well as a drought have disrupted Zimbabwe 's food production and famine is already looming in much of the country .####[]
None Meanwhile , Foreign Affairs spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said Mbeki 's deputy , Jacob Zuma would represent the country at the controversially re-elected President Robert Mugabe 's latest inauguration , scheduled for Sunday in Harare .####[]

None Cuito , 25 Jan ( Angop ) -####[]
None A road convoy which came in from Benguela Province carrying 1,500 metric tons of assorted goods arrived in the city of Cuito , the capital of Bie Province , on Tuesday [ 22 Jan ] .####[]
None The aim of this aid is to reduce the shortages faced by local population .####[]
None According to convoy chief Eusebio da Silva Ferreira , the convoy included 35 trucks , and it ferried 720 metric tons of corn , 623 metric tons of peas , and 157 metric tons of beans .####[]
None He added that the above mentioned products will help offset the difficult social conditions of more than 460,000 people in need in the province .####[]
None These aid goods have arrived at a time when the World Food Program , WFP is cutting down on air transportation of aid to Bie Province from 3,500 metric tons to 2,000 metric tons .####[]
None This is because of the high costs involved , and the poor conditions of the local landing strip .####[]
None Because of these problems , the WFP has not been able to provide all the necessary assistance to people in need , who are estimated to total more than 460,000 .####[]
None Chinese space exploration :####[]
None When will a Chinese cosmonaut fly into space ?####[]
None Shenzhou - 3 orbited the Earth 108 times , and successfully landed on the targeted site in inner Mongolia : the Chinese space program is developing .####[]
None The 47th congress of the International Federation of Astronautics that took place six years ago in Beijing was remarkable for the large number of cosmonauts who participated .####[]
None There was even an Austrian there , but the country who organized the forum , the third country on the rating of space explorers , was not represented .####[]
None This can partially be explained with the third position on the rating .####[]
None A Czech , Austrian , Bulgarian , or a Dutch citizen is not entitled to give the command " Go ! " like Yury Gagarin did if they are only guests on the Russian Soyuz station or American Shuttle .####[]
None China will not agree to put its citizens on a foreign spaceship , as it must launch its own space vehicle from its own cosmodrome .####[]
None Mao Tse-tung was passionate about this idea .####[([6, 8], [3, 4], [1, 3], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None Here is an interesting detail from his unpublished " Moscow speech " that was delivered to Chinese students studying in Russia .####[]
None Mao Tse-tung mentioned the fact of the recent Soviet launch of the first ever satellite , weighing 70 kilos ; then he turned to the Chinese ambassador and asked him : " Do you weigh 70 kilos , ambassador Liu Xiao ?####[]
None " A bit less than that , " was the answer .####[]
None " There you see !####[]
None The Soviet Union can launch ambassador Liu Xiao into space !####[]
None America cannot do it so far . "####[]
None Was it only the wish of socialist propaganda in those words ?####[]
None That speech was delivered on November 15 , 1957 , and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China authorized its rocket production program a year before that , in October of 1956 ( on Mao Tse-tung 's initiative ) .####[]
None The specialized Fifth Institute of the Defense Ministry was established for that purpose .####[]
None Two years ago , in October of 1955 , Beijing received a person with the reputation of the " Chinese Korolev " Qian Xuesen , who came to China from the USA , where he had settled after graduating from Shanghai university , so it would be better to call him " Chinese von Broun . "####[]
None Xuesen continued his studies at California Technical University , having obtained a Doctor of Astronautics degree , and , as the say , the title of US Air Force colonel .####[]
None He then was employed at a US Air Force rocket engine lab and succeeded there .####[]
None In the summer of 1950 , he made an attempt to move to Beijing .####[]
None FBI agents caught him and his wife at the airport of Los Angeles , as well as luggage that contained 896 pounds of books and records .####[]
None Xuesen was released only after five years only , after the " quarantine " during which he was not allowed access to the secret information .####[]
None Xuesen became the supervisor of the research works in the field , but the Chinese spaceships of the Shenzhou type looked like the Russian Soyuz , specialists say .####[]
None At the same time , when the Chinese von Broun managed to reach China , there were other bearers of fresher secrets there from the country , which could " launch ambassador Liu Xiao into space . "####[]
None The Chinese students who graduated from Russian universities and Soviet experts of nuclear and missile technologies .####[]
None The " elder brother " ( the Chinese people used to call the Soviet Union this ) was not against helping the " younger brother " in the field of modernization .####[([23, 27], [18, 22], [13, 16], 'Positive', 'Weak')]
None By the time of Mao Tse-tung 's " Moscow speech , " the Chinese were actively searching for a site for their rocket range .####[]
None The committee of the competent departments prepared seven variants with the help of Soviet experts .####[]
None The choice was made for a site in the Gobi Desert .####[]
None The construction of the Jiuquan cosmodrome was started there ; it was put into operation at the end of 1958 .####[]
None China 's three ( unmanned ) spaceships were launched into space from there :####[]
None Shenzhou - 1 was launched on November 20 , 1999 ; it stayed in the orbit for about 24 hours , having orbited the Earth 14 times .####[]
None Shenzhou - 2 blasted off on January 10 , 2001 , staying about a week in the orbit , having flown 108 times around the planet .####[]
None Shenzhou - 3 ( blasted off on March 25 ) stayed in space for the same period of time , with the same number of circuits around the Earth .####[]
None The current goal is to examine the module and its contents ( like in the first two cases ) .####[]
None However , it is evident now that China has reliable rocket systems ; it has mastered the art of space navigation and soft landing of a spaceship .####[]
None China knows how to build its own spaceships , and there are people who can become cosmonauts .####[]
None Their training is in full swing ( Russia is reportedly participating ) .####[]
None As China 's experts believe , there should be at least four test unmanned flights performed before they can launch a man into space .####[]
None Therefore , the " Chinese Gagarin " will probably say " Go ! " no later than 2005 .####[]
None China is also working on programs for Chinese cosmonauts to fly to the Moon , as well as a space station .####[]

None What kind of work does Goodwill do ?####[]
None Goodwill finds jobs for people with mental and physical disabilities .####[]
None After Maureen 's job coach taught her how to do her job in a restaurant , we helped Maureen step out of the shadow sometimes cast over people with physical and mental disabilities and find a fulfilling job smack dab in the middle of society .####[]
None Remember what she said in my last letter ?####[]
None " If I was n't working here ... I would be sad ... "####[]
None Goodwill helps people get off of public assistance .####[]
None Sherry learned through our Future Works class that she could rise out of the mire of the welfare system and support her family .####[]

None Please use the enclosed envelope to give a generous gift to Goodwill today !####[]
None Sincerely , William A Carter , Chairman Goodwill Industries Foundation P.S.####[]
None Your gift is a wise investment in the community .####[]
None For every dollar donated to Goodwill in 1998 , we helped our " graduates " earn an estimated $ 102 .####[]
None That money was then spent in a variety of ways , adding fuel to our thriving economy .####[]
None Amman , March 25 ( Petra ) -- Their Majesties King Abdullah II and Queen Rania Al - Abdullah Sunday returned home following a working visit included Spain , Britain , USA and Mexico .####[]

None C'wealth mission conduct questionable####[]
None By A Special Correspondent - Britain's Prime Minister , Tony Blair , privately did two things concerning Zimbabwe during the recent " retreat " by Commonwealth leaders in Australia that raise questions about today 's meeting in London by the troika of Australia , Nigeria and South Africa .####[]
None The first was that Blair said he had received an interim report from the Commonwealth observer mission to Zimbabwe that condemned the outcome of the presidential election - before Zimbabweans had even had a chance to vote .####[([22, 28], [20, 22], [5, 6], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None But how could Blair have " a Commonwealth report " when no one else had received such a report that should be channeled through the Secretariat to all members , asked one of the other 53 Commonwealth leaders at the retreat ?####[]
None The British leader fudged his reply and the Commonwealth leaders were left with the distinct impression that the " Blair report " had already been written in London before the Commonwealth mission even left for Zimbabwe .####[]
None Their mission was simply to rubber stamp the adverse report that Britain had already written .####[([0], [8, 11], [11, 13], 'Negative', 'Weak')]
None Blair 's second faux pas in Australia , according to some of the assembled Commonwealth leaders , came in his response to a remarkably conciliatory speech by Zimbabwe 's Foreign Minister , Dr Stan Mudenge .####[([0], [24, 27], [33, 36], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None The Nigerian leader , President Olusegun Obasanjo , had urged the minister not to attack Blair frontally over Britain 's negative position regarding Zimbabwe , but to deal with the presidential election preparations in a dispassionate and precise manner .####[([23, 25], [20, 22], [18, 20], 'Negative', 'Weak'), ([16], [14, 15], [4, 8], 'Negative', 'Strong'), ([11, 40], [9, 11], [4, 8], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([14, 25], [9, 11], [4, 8], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None The Zimbabwean minister did this .####[]
None Then Mudenge rose to his feet , strode over to Blair and thrust out his hand .####[([11, 12], [12, 17], [1, 3], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None The hand symbolised reconciliation ; and Blair accepted it .####[([0, 1], [7, 10], [7], 'Positive', 'Weak')]
None Then Mudenge proposed that Britain and Zimbabwe bury past differences and work together in the future .####[([4, 6], [2, 4], [1, 2], 'Neutral', 'Weak')]
None The Commonwealth leaders , many of them in the first place unable to understand the dispute between Zimbabwe and its former coloniser , Britain , breathed a collective sigh of relief at what they hoped was the beginning of the healing process .####[([33, 43], [25, 32], [1, 4], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([0], [25, 32], [1, 4], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([0], [15, 16], [17, 25], 'Negative', 'Weak'), ([36, 43], [35, 36], [1, 4], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None But there was still an unanswered question in the minds of the Commonwealth leaders :####[([0], [5, 11], [12, 15], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None How had the British Prime Minister seen the purported " Commonwealth report on Zimbabwe " when they had not ?####[]
None Meanwhile , back in Harare , some strange things were happening with the Commonwealth mission .####[]
None They had been pre-booked by the Zimbabwean Ministry of Foreign Affairs into the partly Government -owned Sheraton Hotel .####[]
None On the spurious grounds that the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front ( Zanu - PF ) election campaign centre was in an adjoining building , the Commonwealth observers moved out to the privately owned Meikles Hotel .####[]
None There , unlike the Sheraton where the national newspaper####[]
None The Herald is distributed to guests , the pro-opposition Daily News is given freely to guests .####[]
None Furthermore , as anyone who has been following the Zimbabwean Press can testify , many of the Meikles farms around the country have been acquired by the State as part of the land reform programme .####[]
None Meikles####[]
None Hotel has long been known as a hot bed of opposition politics .####[]
None During the 2000 parliamentary elections , 80 rooms at Meikles Hotel were booked by the British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) .####[]
None But because of their openly hostile position towards the President and Government , the BBC was refused accreditation to cover the presidential election .####[([14, 16], [16, 17], [0], 'Negative', 'Weak'), ([9, 13], [4, 7], [14, 16], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None While the Commonwealth observer mission and many of the foreign journalists were assembled in the hotel , the opposition leader of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , Morgan Tsvangirai , moved in with them , taking a complete floor for himself and his entourage .####[]
None It is notable that the Commonwealth observer mission did not move again although the opposition had now joined them in the same hotel .####[]
None There was also the curious appointment of and behaviour by individual members of the Commonwealth mission who should have been sworn to secrecy as part of their mission and who should have expressed their views only through the chair of the mission .####[]
None Instead , an Australian member of the Federal Parliament , Julie Bishop , vented her anger towards the President and Government , and the electoral process , in Australia 's media .####[([18, 28], [13, 16], [11, 13], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None The composition of the Commonwealth mission raised further questions .####[]
None Why were several former and recent employees of the Commonwealth Secretariat accredited as observers ?####[]
None Normally staff make up the Secretariat in support of a mission populated by more eminent , neutral persons .####[]
None A Namibian woman member of the Commonwealth observer mission , who is the well - respected , Deputy Speaker of the National Council in her country , held different views to those stated in the interim Commonwealth report that was released only after the election results were known .####[([1, 10], [14, 17], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None Although the Commonwealth missions nominally operate on the basis of " consensus " , she and others of a similar view were dismissed as " troublemakers " by one of the former Secretariat staff-cum-observer .####[([15, 22], [22, 25], [29, 35], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None The final straw that confirmed that Australia had abandoned any pretence of fairness to all sides in the dispute came when the Australian Prime Minister , John Howard , ordered his High Commissioner in Harare not to attend Sunday 's inauguration of Robert Mugabe as President of Zimbabwe .####[([0], [8, 12], [6, 8], 'Neutral', 'Average'), ([0], [18, 20], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None The Australians , in common with other white members of the Commonwealth , the European Union ( EU ) , the Americans , Norwegians and the Swiss stayed away from that event saying they do not recognise the election and therefore Mugabe as the head of State .####[]
None These are some of the realities that Presidents Obasanjo of Nigeria and Thabo Mbeki of South Africa , confronted as they flew from Harare last night for their meeting in London tomorrow with the Australian leader who is the third member of the Commonwealth troika .####[]
None Howard , however , will not be isolated at the three -member meeting at Marlborough House in London .####[]
None The Commonwealth Secretary - General , Don McKinnon of New Zealand is also known to support his country 's decision to condemn Zimbabwe 's presidential election .####[([22, 27], [19, 22], [17, 19], 'Negative', 'Strong'), ([17, 27], [15, 17], [7, 12], 'Neutral', 'Weak'), ([22, 27], [15, 17], [7, 12], 'Neutral', 'Weak')]
None And close by , Howard will have the British government and the western media .####[]
None Presidents Obasanjo and Mbeki , however , have the benefit of their own observer missions to Zimbabwe as well as the support of the vast majority of the Commonwealth .####[([0, 5], [21, 23], [24, 30], 'Positive', 'Weak')]
None And , in line with Commonwealth consensus , the views of the majority are taken to be the views of the Commonwealth as a whole .####[]
None No doubt Blair will fight on .####[]
None But the solution to the present impasse lies with the people of Zimbabwe and Africa , not with the people of Britain and Europe .####[]
None .START####[]
None Trustcorp Inc. will become Society Bank & Trust when its merger is completed with Society Corp. of Cleveland , the bank said .####[]
None Society Corp. , which is also a bank , agreed in June to buy Trustcorp for 12.4 million shares of stock with a market value of about $ 450 million .####[]
None The transaction is expected to close around year end .####[]
None The European Parliament , which convened yesterday in Strasbourg , decided to advise the 15 member states of the European Union to impose economic sanctions on Israel and , specifically , to suspend association agreements with Jerusalem .####[([26, 28], [12, 14], [1, 4], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([36, 38], [12, 14], [1, 4], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([26, 28], [22, 23], [1, 4], 'Negative', 'Average'), ([36, 38], [22, 23], [1, 4], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None In addition , the Parliament called for imposing a weapons embargo on Israel and the Palestinian Authority .####[([7, 18], [5, 7], [4, 5], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([12, 18], [7, 9], [4, 5], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None For some time , European politicians have threatened to suspend economic ties with Israel -- a move , which in light of close and extensive trade relations between EU member states and Israel , could cause serious damage .####[([13, 16], [7, 9], [4, 7], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None Earlier this week , Belgian Foreign Minister Louis Michel , who does not miss an opportunity to provoke Israel , threatened that the EU would once again reconsider its relations with Jerusalem .####[([31, 33], [25, 29], [4, 10], 'Neutral', 'Average'), ([18, 20], [17, 18], [4, 10], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None European Commission President Romano Prodi expressed similar sentiments : in his opinion , the EU should consider imposing an economic " punishment " on Israel in protest against the operations of the Israel Defense Forces in the territories .####[([24, 26], [15, 19], [0, 5], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([29, 39], [26, 29], [0, 5], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None The same goes for Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Pique , who was offended after Israel refused to allow him and EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana to meet with PA Chairman Yasser Arafat in Ramallah .####[([14, 36], [12, 13], [4, 10], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None Despite the Parliament 's recommendation , the chances that the association agreements will be suspended are very slim .####[]

None Elaborating on the ' axis of evil '####[]
None PRESIDENT GEORGE Bush 's National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice has recently " defined " the context and scope of the term " axis of evil " that Bush used in his State of the Union address a few weeks ago to describe Iraq , Iran and North Korea .####[]
None The criteria set by Rice are the following : the three countries in question are repressive and grave human rights violators , and aggressively seeking weapons of mass destruction .####[]
None By all conservative estimates , there are scores of other countries which can easily qualify as repressive and violating human rights .####[]
None The rule , as far as human rights are concerned , is that every nation which does not enjoy pluralistic democracy is violating human rights and is therefore oppressive .####[]
None There are many countries in the world that hardly qualify as pluralistic democracies .####[]
None On this count , the national security adviser may have erred .####[]
None As for her wording regarding acquisition of weapons , what is particularly noteworthy is the use of the words " aggressively seeking " nuclear , biological or chemical weapons .####[]
None In other words , countries which are seeking or developing such arsenal at a slow pace do not seem to come within the scope of the " axis of evil " .####[]
None One can name more than a dozen countries which are contemplating the acquisition of mass destruction weapons at one speed or another .####[([12, 18], [10, 12], [4, 8], 'Neutral', 'Weak')]
None All other countries which are seemingly refraining from acquiring such weapons are doing so not so much to escape being branded as " evil " but rather because they have neither the knowledge nor the money to join the " nuclear club " .####[]
None Come to think of it , acquiring weapons of mass destruction per se may not be a correct basis for judging whether a nation is good or evil .####[]
None The mere development or possession of mass destruction weapons is not in itself a reason to label a state as evildoer .####[]
None After all , the US is the first nation to have developed nuclear weapons .####[]
None Moreover , the US is the first and only nation ever to deploy such weapons .####[]
None Perhaps the real criterion in this context is whether the nuclear country is democratic in every sense of the word .####[]
None Washington seems to be particularly disturbed and feel that its own national security is being threatened only when the nations which acquire mass destruction weapons are authoritarian or repressive , irrespective of the pace of amassing weaponry .####[([18, 30], [4, 7], [0, 1], 'Negative', 'Strong'), ([18, 30], [8, 9], [0, 1], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None This is , in fact , the fear of all countries , as they feel that democratic regimes are more restrained and responsible when it comes to resorting to weapons of mass destruction .####[([1, 3], [7, 9], [14, 15], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None If this is the case , Rice could have elaborated more precise criteria for membership in the " axis of evil , " by establishing more clearly the connection between the nature of the regime and the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction .####[]
None During the past weeks Europe and America witnessed the arrangement of important international conferences , which could on the one hand guarantee the peace and stability of the world , or could instead deteriorate the conditions .####[]
None The conference in New York , which dealt with a ban on demand for light arms , and the Genoa Conference which had a much wider and extended agenda , had two common features between them .####[]
None The first was that large and numerous bodies of dissidents were opposing the wishes and interests of a small but powerful group .####[([13, 23], [11, 13], [5, 11], 'Negative', 'Average'), ([0], [13, 18], [5, 11], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None The second feature was that both conferences ended without effective result , and the decisions taken and resolutions adopted there lacked conclusiveness and were not operational .####[]
None The Bonn Conference however , which dealt with the global environment and examined the condition of world climate , could be appraised as an exception and a relative success .####[([1, 3], [21, 23], [0], 'Positive', 'Weak')]
None After two weeks of discussion and exchange of views at the New York Conference , it was decided to pay heed to the resolute demands advanced by the majority of the participants , who emphatically insisted on the imposition of a ban on the sale of light weaponry .####[([0], [23, 28], [28, 33], 'Positive', 'Strong'), ([38, 49], [34, 37], [28, 33], 'Neutral', 'Strong'), ([44, 49], [34, 37], [28, 33], 'Neutral', 'Strong')]
None But paying heed was not tantamount to endorsement of the demand launched by those countries ; rather , the final result came out as a compromise solution and a relative back up by the majority group .####[([0], [10, 13], [14, 16], 'Positive', 'Strong'), ([10, 16], [7, 9], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None The joint demand and stand by the majority of countries attending the conference was encountered by firm opposition by the United States [ of America ] .####[([1, 14], [17, 19], [20, 27], 'Negative', 'Strong'), ([0], [2, 6], [7, 14], 'Neutral', 'Strong')]
None American delegates at the conference maintained that any restriction or ban on the sale , possession , and carrying of light armaments was practically the same as limiting the freedom of action [ as published ] of American citizens , and equal to reducing their margin of security .####[([8, 23], [5, 7], [0, 5], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None This is while possessing arms for self - defense is itself a factor that breeds insecurity .####[]
None Critics of the meeting , on the margin of the conference , up held the view that the American government , instead of heeding the wishes of international community , and protecting the security of world nations , and above all the safety of its own citizens , has paid more attention to the interests of corporations and huge arms producers and military - industrial complexes that reap tremendous profits annually from the sale of such armaments .####[([0], [25, 27], [0, 6], 'Neutral', 'Average'), ([18, 21], [13, 17], [0, 6], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None ( It should be noted that the issues moved at the conference were declared unofficial and lacking validity [ legal force ] even for the participating countries . )####[]
None [ Sentences are as published ]####[]
None The most important of the three conferences , which subsequently gained even more prominence , was the conference in Genova ; perhaps even more so for the results " not obtained " at the conference , and which led to the subsequent intense dissatisfaction and frustration of the leading industrial states attending the meeting .####[([27, 36], [42, 47], [48, 51], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None The governments attending the conference had a long and varied agenda , including : economic globalization , the anti-missile shield defense project , the Kyoto Protocol and environmental protection , the political and military crises in the Middle East , the Balkans , and Afghanistan , moratorium on the accumulated debt of the poor countries , and ... [ as published ]####[]
None They meant to reach some form of agreement or understanding about those issues , but unexpected events left all that in limbo and uncertainty .####[]
None The conference opened with fierce demonstrations by the opponents of economic globalization , who maintained that what is being concocted by globalization is in fact poverty .####[([21, 23], [14, 16], [14], 'Neutral', 'Average'), ([10, 13], [4, 7], [14], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None When Italian police intervened and roughly handled the demonstrations , things got out of hand ; the already volatile situation reached boiling point , violent clashes broke out , and the killing of one protestor overshadowed all other issues .####[([0], [8, 10], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None The whole incident was in fact unprecedented in the history of European democracies , and has prompted a whole range of controversies and debates .####[]
None It can safely be claimed that the events in Genoa have influenced [ overshadowed ] the very conferences in New York and Bonn ; whereas , from the onset , the weak results of Genoa was foreseeable for most observers .####[]
None Because , from the very start it could be predicted that on the subject of economic globalization , the developed and capitalist states were going to come across fierce opposition by dissident groups and the supporters of economic growth in poor countries .####[([19, 24], [28, 31], [31, 43], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None Regarding the American proposed Anti-Missile Defense System too , neither Russia , China , Japan , nor even the European Union , had shown any enthusiasm ; rather they had all expressed their reserves on the project .####[([2, 8], [25, 27], [10, 22], 'Neutral', 'Average'), ([36, 38], [31, 32], [10, 22], 'Neutral', 'Weak')]
None Concerning the environmental protection issue , the emission of toxic and greenhouse gases , and warming up of the planet earth 's climate too , which was somehow related to the [ agenda of ]####[]
None Bonn Conference , America had relentlessly demonstrated its paradoxical [ as published ] [ controversial ] position and particular stance opposed to that of other developed states by her previous abandonment of the Kyoto Protocol .####[]
None Whereas , beforehand , it was anticipated and hoped that the agreements reached at Genoa would help bring about beneficial results for the Bonn conference as well .####[([10, 28], [6, 8], [0], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([10, 28], [9, 10], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None Even the eagerness for playing an intermediary role in the Middle East crisis has given rise to fierce competition between America , European Union , and Russia and China .####[([4, 14], [2, 4], [20, 30], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None And it is likely that until each party seeks its own particular interest in the conflict , and until the rivalry persists , the question would continue to remain unresolved .####[]
None What , however , was most remarkable in the conferences in New York and Genoa , was the fact that most decisions made , were based on interests and tastes of particular groups [ lobbies ] .####[([0], [27, 29], [31, 37], 'Neutral', 'Average'), ([0], [29, 31], [31, 37], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None Here are the views expressed by two of the prominent characters attending the Genoa Conference .####[]
None Jacques Chirac , the French President , responding to the protests leveled by opponents of globalization , had said : " They have no right to present themselves as defenders of the world poor ... "####[([15, 17], [10, 13], [13, 17], 'Negative', 'Strong'), ([27, 29], [26, 27], [0, 7], 'Neutral', 'Weak')]
None Similarly , Gerhard Schroeder , the German Chancellor , too had claimed that the participants at the summit meeting were the true , legitimate , and elected representatives of the people of their countries .####[]
None In the remarks made by these political leaders , one point is interesting and calls for reflection : if these leaders reject the interference of others in the condition and destiny of the poor nations , while present themselves legitimate and competent to make far reaching decisions for them , then it must be said that they are only the elected [ leaders ] of their own nation [ people ] , and this does not entitle them to act as representative or legal attorney of all people worldwide !####[([23, 36], [21, 23], [20, 21], 'Negative', 'Weak')]
None [ Exclamation mark as published ]####[]
None In view of the criticisms , which have been made , they could perhaps be also considered to be the representative of powerful corporations that have placed the whole " world economy " under their influence , and as a result of that they are also controlling the world of politics globally .####[([0], [4, 6], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None At the Bonn Conference too , the agenda was to tackle and discuss the most urgent and indispensable factors concerning the life of humankind .####[]
None The remarkable feature of this conference was the joint resolution adopted by 180 countries worldwide --- in regard to protection of environment , and above all reducing the emission of greenhouse gases --- , which has isolated America in an undeniable way .####[]
None It was due to this isolation that America , in spite of discrediting [ undermining ] the Kyoto Protocol and declining to comply with the Bonn Conference [ resolution ] , was forced to at least make a promise to cooperate in preventing an increase in air pollution .####[]
None To recap , if there ever existed any possibility that at the conferences of New York and Genoa questions regarding : promotion of world security , improvement of economic conditions , defusing regional and global crises and conflicts , checking unleashed competition for rearmament , reduction of the gap between the mainstream and peripheral countries , and ... could be addressed and appropriate , serious , and worthy measures for their solution could be adopted , the opportunity was very easily lost and the meetings flopped completely .####[]
None As regards the recent conference ( Bonn Meeting ) , although the past gatherings like the Hague meeting and Kyoto conference have proved to be failed experiences , nevertheless as the climatic and atmospheric crises are growing more serious , one can be optimistic and hopeful about the success of such protocols and pacts , and implementation of the agreements , even though they are not protected by any sanctions .####[([48, 61], [43, 46], [41, 42], 'Positive', 'Average')]

None In fiscal 1988 , the company earned $ 17.3 million , or $ 1.92 a share , on revenue of $ 352.9 million .####[]

None The nationwide polling results , released by the country 's electoral authorities Wednesday , gave Mugabe of the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union -- Patriotic Front ( ZANU - PF ) 1,685 , 212 votes , or 56 percent , against his closest rival , Morgan Tsvangirai of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , with 1 , 258,401 votes , or 41.7 percent .####[]

None Analysts said Mugabe , the last of the old African nationalists who rode to power on the colonial winds of change , has won on the strength of the appeal of ZANU - PF 's land policy , under which the government was seizing idle farms from white farmers , who own the bulk of the country 's arable land , to resettle landless peasants .####[([32, 38], [32, 38], [0, 2], 'Neutral', 'Average')]

None Rosaviakosmos Director Yuriy Koptev , in his turn , told the president that , at present , Russia was actively interacting with European countries on " the interchangeability " of the ISS ' American segment .####[]
None Koptev explained that the USA has suspended the ISS development programme until a deficit of 4.7 bn dollars is paid off .####[]
None According to Koptev , such interaction with Europe would make it possible for six spacemen to be on board the ISS rather than the current three , as well as to use a Russian Soyuz rocket as a rescue spaceship .####[]

None a brief History Prehistoric man in Asia Minor ( now modern Turkey ) or Greece could look out across the Aegean toward the horizon and see the faint silhouette of land .####[]
None Their curiosity pushed them to build vessels that were strong enough to ford the open seas and reach these islands , marking the start of the long legacy of Mediterranean seafaring .####[]
None Around 7000 b.c. , the Phoenicians set out from what is now Iran to explore their surroundings .####[]
None They eventually reached the islands , and founded colonies on the islands in the northernmost part of the Aegean Sea .####[]
None An important early material , obsidian , was discovered on the island of Milos .####[]
None Obsidian is a hard , vitreous volcanic rock , which could be fashioned into tools for cutting and stabbing .####[]
None The high quality of the seam on Milos ensured that the area remained popular with early travelers .####[]
None The basic elements of life in the Aegean began to come together as early as 5000 b.c. , and were already in place by the late Bronze Age ( c. 2700 b.c. ) .####[]
None The major changes were not to daily tasks and routines , but to the political power base , which changed regularly and not necessarily peacefully throughout the ages .####[]
None Cycladic Culture At around 3500 b.c. , a sophisticated culture evolved in the Cyclades islands .####[]
None The distinctive , sculpted marble figures of the era are now being reproduced in vast quantities as souvenirs .####[]
None You will find original examples in the archaeological museums throughout the Cyclades , although one of the earliest examples is in the museum on Paros .####[]
None The people farmed and fished ; on the dawning of the Bronze Age in 2700 b.c. , they began to work with metals .####[]
None The Cycladic culture was influenced by societies in the east , importing the pottery wheel from Mesopotamia .####[]
None They also continued to trade in obsidian and the local marble .####[]
None The Minoans and the Myceneans Farther south in Crete , the Minoan culture developed after 2000 b.c. into the most significant of its age , spreading its influence throughout the region by trade and diplomacy .####[]
None Santorini ( Thira ) , the next major island north , was heavily influenced by Crete , and the settlements of Thira and Akrotiri thrived at this time .####[]
None The magnificent frescoes and mosaics found at Akrotiri are in Athens at present , but the remains of the buildings at the site provide ample evidence of the sophistication of the culture here .####[]
None Around 1500 b.c. , a massive volcanic eruption at Santorini destroyed not only Akrotiri -- under feet of ash and pumice -- but the whole Minoan civilization .####[]
None Massive tidal waves swept over Crete , and other parts of the Mediterranean , smashing buildings and drowning many thousands of people .####[]
None In the wake of this tremendous natural upheaval , the Aegean Islands next came under the influence of the Mycenaeans ( at around 1300 b.c. ) , who had a base in the Peloponnese region of the Greek mainland .####[]
None The Mycenaeans were an acquisitive race who came to conquer , not to trade .####[]
None Their extensive military campaigns were later chronicled by Homer in his epic poems####[]
None The Odyssey and The Iliad .####[]
None The Rise of Athens####[]
None The Dorians , who came overland from northern Europe , conquered the Mycenaeans .####[]
None They were a barbaric race , and their custody of the area brought about a dark period during which the written word was forgotten and art disappeared .####[]
None They held sway over islands off the northern Greek coast , but the Phoenicians kept control of the main sea routes ; south of the area , trade continued as usual .####[]
None At the same time , city -states began to grow in influence on the southern Greek mainland .####[]
None Athens became the most powerful , heralding the start of the classical Greek period .####[]
None However , Greece was not yet a country ; each city -state was self - governing and autonomous .####[]
None The new culture spread throughout the Mediterranean , helped by a huge increase in migration from the mainland to new settlements such as Carthage , a Greek city on the African coast of the Mediterranean .####[]
None Culture and the arts flourished once again .####[]
None Athletic prowess was admired and the Olympic games were constituted in 776 b.c. , to promote friendly competition .####[([0], [3, 5], [0], 'Positive', None)]
None Homer wrote his epic works on Chios ; and lyrical poetry was much admired , particularly the work of the poets Archilochos on Paros and Sappho on Lesvos .####[([9, 12], [12, 15], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None The preeminent islands of this era were Delos , a sacred island and center of religion ruled by Athens ; Samos , ruled by the tyrant Polycrates ; and Naxos , whose ruler Lygdamis undertook some major building projects .####[]
None Archaeology shows that , during this time , societies lived mainly in coastal trading towns with little settlement inland .####[]
None The Persian Wars As Athens rose in influence and power in the West , it was matched in the East by the rise of the Persian Empire .####[]
None From a power base in Anatolia , the Persians overran the eastern Aegean Islands and set their sights on the Cyclades .####[([20, 22], [16, 19], [8, 9], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None In 490 b.c. , they captured sacred Delos and razed the settlements on Naxos .####[]
None The island communities were undecided about which side to back for a time .####[]
None Paros and Andros contributed to the Persian armory , while others supported Athens .####[]
None The two superpowers finally clashed at the epic battles of Marathon and Salamis in 480 b.c .####[]
None The Persians were defeated , and Athens duly punished the islands that had turned against it .####[([0, 1], [13, 17], [10, 13], 'Negative', 'Average'), ([10, 17], [8, 10], [6, 8], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None Following its victory , Athens introduced the concept of a mutual protection alliance ( a kind of NATO of the ancient world ) .####[]
None Several islands and Greek city -states agreed to work together , and created a treasury to fund their plans , which was held on the island of Delos .####[]
None The alliance became known as the Delian League .####[]
None Although there were minor internal wrangles , the league controlled the Aegean and the greater Athenian Empire for most of the fifth century b.c. Later , in 454 b.c. , the treasury was transferred to Athens and its deposits were used to finance the construction of many of the major buildings and temples of the Classical Age .####[]
None In 431 b.c. , Athens began a war with its neighbor and league member Sparta .####[]
None Although the islands saw little action , as the war went on they could see that Athens was slowly losing its power .####[]
None Before the end of the war in 401 b.c. , many islands had already transferred their allegiance to the victors , who were led by Philip II of Macedon .####[]
None He was followed in 336 b.c. by his son Alexander the Great , one of the most remarkable leaders in history .####[]
None His rise to power ushered in the Hellenistic period .####[]
None Hellenistic and Roman Periods When Alexander went on to conquer lands as far to the east as India , the Aegean became a crossroads for the long trading routes .####[]
None Delos became one of the largest marketplaces in the empire .####[]
None Following Alexander ' s death , his lands were divided among his generals .####[]
None Much of the Aegean came under the rule of the Ptolemies , along with Egypt .####[]
None Cleopatra was a member of this famous ruling clan .####[]
None Although in 88 b.c. , Mithradates made a swift and successful raid from the East across Asia Minor and the Aegean Islands , the next major power change brought influence from the West .####[]
None The Greek Hellenistic Empire was gradually , and peacefully , absorbed into the Roman Empire .####[]
None The Byzantine Empire and the Coming of Christianity####[]
None The Romans ruled a pagan empire , but the Aegean had an important influence on the early development of Christianity .####[]
None In a.d. 95 , St. John arrived on Patmos , a small rocky island in the Dodecanese , as a political prisoner .####[]
None It was here that he wrote what was to become the final book of the New Testament , the Book of Revelation .####[]
None It wasn ' t until a.d. 330 , however , when the newly converted Emperor Constantine made Byzantium , renamed Constantinople , capital of his Eastern Empire that Christianity was assured of its dominant role in future Greek life .####[]
None The Byzantine Empire had powerful and well - fortified cities , but the countryside and the outlying islands were ravaged by waves of invaders .####[]
None In an attempt to counter a threat from the Saracen Muslims , a new potent religious force from the East , the Byzantine army forcefully enlisted the men of the islands .####[]
None Disease took a further toll .####[]
None By the time of the Crusades , many of the Aegean islands had been practically depopulated .####[]
None As the Byzantine Empire weakened at the end of the first millennium , Crusader forces were sent from Western Europe to counter the Muslim forces and retake Jerusalem for the Christian faith .####[]
None Unfortunately , their zeal was not matched by their discrimination .####[([0], [4, 5], [3, 4], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None The crusaders swept through the l;and of Byzantium slaughtering Christians as well as Muslims , civilians as well as soldiers .####[]
None Constantinople was taken by Crusader forces in 1204 , and they stripped the city of manyof its finest treasures -- which now grace the public buildings of Venice -- although a large consignment of books and manuscripts was transferred to the monastery at Patmos before the city fell .####[]
None While Byzantine land was being divided , there was no one in control of the seas , so pirates raided towns on many of the islands .####[]
None To counter this , the populations moved from their homes on the coast and built settlements inland , out of sight of the raiding parties .####[]
None This created a pattern seen today throughout the Aegean of a small port ( skala ) which serves an inland settlement or chora , making it easier to protect the island from attack .####[]
None The minor Aegean Islands were taken by various powerful European noblemen , many of whom were Genoese or Venetian , such as Marco Sanudo on Naxos .####[]
None The noblemen had free rein to create their own fiefdoms .####[]
None The Venetians fortified their main towns -- Naxos Town and Antiparos####[]
None Town are wonderful examples of this -- creating labyrinths of narrow alleys and cul-de-sacs that were designed to confuse and to demoralize invaders .####[([8, 15], [21, 22], [22, 24], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None The Genoese took control of the eastern Aegean Islands , which were considered the most valuable for agriculture and trade .####[]
None After a final bloody defeat by the Muslims in 1309 , Christian forces were forced from the Holy Land .####[]
None The Knights of St. John , a holy military force , made their way to Rhodes and Kos in the Dodecanese .####[]
None They began the process of building their strong citadels , and reinforcing the Christian faith on the islands .####[]
None However , they had not seen the last of their Muslim foe .####[]
None A force was gaining strength in the east to threaten their new bases .####[]
None The Coming of the Ottoman Turks####[]
None The Ottomans were roving invaders who came from the east , taking land in what is now Turkey .####[]
None By the end of the 13th century , they began their first raids on the Aegean Islands .####[]
None In 1453 , they took Constantinople , and immediately made it their capital , renaming it Istanbul .####[]
None They then set their sights on the islands of the Knights of St. John and , after an unsuccessful siege in 1480 , they finally ejected the knights from the Dodecanese in 1522 .####[]
None In 1566 , they wrested Chios from the Genoese , bolstering their hold on the eastern Aegean Islands , but the Cyclades remained in Venetian hands for another generation or more -- Tinos was the last to fall in 1715 .####[]
None The Ottomans brought new influences to the islands that they controlled , forming a large empire that stretched around the eastern Mediterranean .####[]
None Toward Greek Independence####[]
None However , a movement was growing on the Greek peninsula against Ottoman rule and for an independent Greek state .####[([11, 14], [3, 5], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average'), ([16, 20], [3, 5], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None In 1770 , Russia came to aid the Greeks ( defined by their Orthodox religion rather than by historical geographical boundaries ) , declaring war on the Ottoman Empire and occupying several Aegean islands until 1774 .####[]
None Graffiti written by Russian soldiers can be seen in the caves of Antiparos .####[]
None Although this attempt was unsuccessful , the campaign for a Greek state continued into the 19th century and began to grow in strength .####[]
None The Aegean Islands played their part .####[]
None Lesvos , Chios , and Samos lay in the important shipping lanes , and patriots began disrupting Ottoman cargo traffic .####[]
None In return , the Turks violently put down every insurrection , including the massacre on Chios , when 22,000 people were slaughtered .####[]
None The Ottoman Empire was weakening , however , and in 1821 , the peoples of the Greek mainland achieved nationhood for the first time .####[]
None The Cyclades and the Sporades island chains were also included in this new state .####[]
None A new sense of identity enveloped Greek peoples throughout the Aegean , thus commencing a movement to expand Greece and unify the disparate Orthodox populations .####[]
None The Twentieth Century A series of disastrous decisions at the beginning of the 20th century began to sound a death knell for the Ottoman Empire .####[]
None The Turks lost a short war with Italy , and were forced to relinquish the Dodecanese islands to the Italians .####[]
None Greece took this opportunity to absorb the islands of the northern and eastern Aegean and to add Macedonia to its mainland territories .####[]
None Following this debacle , the Ottomans then allied themselves to Germany in the World War I , losing more territory with the defeat of the Germans in that war .####[]
None Greece was handed a strip of land along the western coast of Asia Minor , which for over 2,000 years had had a substantial Greek population .####[]
None Greece moved in to administer the land , but a new influence upset any grand dreams of making this region a part of greater Greece .####[([17, 26], [15, 17], [0, 1], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None In 1923 , Turkey broke away from the tired Ottoman rulers , and Kemal Ataturk rose to power on a wave of popular support .####[([14, 16], [23, 25], [22, 23], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None He promised a modern state for his people , but as the situation became volatile , civil strife broke out in Turkish cities , and those considered Greek were victims of threats and violence .####[([17], [17, 18], [17], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None Many had to leave their birthplaces , fleeing to Lesvos , Chios , and Samos , the Greek-ruled islands just offshore .####[]
None Thousands of people arrived with little more than the clothes they wore , putting great strain on the resources of the islands .####[]
None Finally , Greece was ousted from its new territory in Asia Minor , which became part of the new Turkish state .####[]
None Greece attempted to stay out of World War II , but Mussolini saw Greece as an ideal addition to his Italian empire .####[([0], [13], [11, 13], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None His forces made a series of attacks from their bases in the Dodecanese islands , including sinking a Greek naval vessel in the harbor of Tinos Town , but they only succeeded in strengthening the resolve of the population against them .####[]
None Later the Germans came in force and occupied many of the islands .####[]
None After the war , in 1949 , the Dodecanese islands finally became part of the Greek nation .####[]
None But the country was politically fragmented , with arguments between monarchists and republicans , right and left , and tension escalated into civil war .####[]
None The struggle bypassed most of the islands , although there was fierce fighting on Samos .####[]
None Even after the fighting stopped more than a decade later , the country was not stable .####[]
None At the same time , the massive growth in air and road transport saw shipping decline in importance .####[]
None The Aegean Islands , which for centuries had been important ports on the trading routes , became the backwaters of this new transport network and the economies of several islands came close to collapse .####[]
None In 1967 , the military took the reins of power in Athens , and until 1974 , the ` `Colonels ' ' held sway with a repressive and brutal regime .####[]
None Many Greek islanders chose to leave rather than live in poverty and terror , and many made new homes in the United States and Australia .####[([0], [4, 5], [1, 3], 'Neutral', 'Weak')]
None The expansion of air travel began the age of mass tourism , and Greece along with the Aegean Islands became exciting destinations for northern Europeans escaping their damp , cool summers .####[([13, 19], [20, 21], [23, 25], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None In 1982 , Greece joined the European Common Market ( now the European Union ) .####[]
None Since this time , membership has been of great monetary benefit to the country .####[]
None The EU has given large subsidies to develop Greece ' s infrastructure and grants to excavate and protect its ancient monuments .####[]
None Airfields have been constructed on a number of the islands , and road systems have been expanded and im proved .####[]
None Private investment has even made an increasingly modern ferry fleet possible .####[]
None Politically , the 1990s have been relatively quite times for the islands , although the divorce of Greek prime minister Andreas Papandreou and his subsequent marriage to a much younger woman caused consternation within conservative Greek society .####[([15, 31], [32, 33], [34, 38], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None As the Balkans flared to war once again , Greek nationalism has stirred , and there have been discussions in the kafeneion about the land of Macedonia returning to the fold of its forefathers .####[]
None Whether this will ever happen remains to be seen , but perhaps the aid offered by Greece to Turkey after 1999 ' s devastating earthquake is a sign that the animosity between these two traditional enemies is beginning to diminish .####[([33, 37], [30, 31], [33, 37], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None Australia 's plans to construct a space port on Christmas Island , located just a stone 's throw , a mere 500 kilometres south of Jakarta , has concerned some in the Indonesian Government .####[([0, 12], [28, 30], [30, 35], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None Although diplomatic overtures to express official objections have not yet been made , the government through the National Space and Flight Agency has already warned of the possible risks facing Indonesia .####[([27, 32], [23, 26], [14, 15], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None The nation should certainly be concerned about the plans to build a rocket launch pad , work on the infrastructure for which is due to start in 2002 , with launches beginning from 2004 .####[([8, 16], [5, 6], [1, 2], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None The problem is , this large-scale project right in our own backyard could not only potentially cause space debris consisting of bits of rocket , fuel and satellites to fall into Indonesian territory , but will also disrupt flights and shipping .####[]
None If a rocket launch fails , debris weighing hundreds of tonnes will be scattered over the densely - populated island of Java or the tourist island of Bali , and on to the east as far as Timor .####[]
None The memory Russia 's####[]
None Mir space station which after 15 years fell to earth on 23 March 2001 is still fresh of .####[]
None Fortunately shrapnel from the former space station , which measured 33 x 30 x 27 metres and weighed 137 tonnes , burned up as it re-entered the earth 's atmosphere somewhere over the Pacific Ocean between Chile and Australia .####[]
None Nevertheless , intact pieces of debris weighing up to 20 to 30 tonnes fell into the Pacific Ocean .####[]
None Prior to that , two Soviet satellites struck the earth .####[]
None Cosmos 1402 in January 1978 fell over the Northern Hemisphere and Cosmos 954 , which contained radioactive substances , crashed above the uninhabited tundra of Canada in September 1977 .####[]
None Even more worrying is the possibility that a space station could be transformed into a military base and pose a threat to Indonesia 's national sovereignty .####[]
None At such close proximity , if bilateral relations with Australia were to take a turn for the worse , firing at Indonesia would be extremely easy .####[]
None On the other hand , Christmas Island is certainly an ideal location for rocket launches due to its proximity to the Equator and the geostationary orbit ( GSO ) .####[]
None [ passage omitted on technical details of operation of GSO ]####[]
None Notwithstanding the above , in reality only three of the 15 launch pad centres worldwide are located near the Equator - Kourou , San Marco and Sriharikota .####[]
None But the famous US space centre , the Kennedy Space Centre at Cape Canaveral in Florida is located relatively far from the Equator .####[]
None Therefore , plans to construct a space port should be moved from Christmas Island if Australia is really willing to listen to Indonesia 's objections .####[([20, 26], [17, 20], [15, 17], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None International law governing accountability if one nation 's space debris falls on another is already in existence .####[]
None The main convention is the UN Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects , 28 March 1972 , known as the 1972 Liability Convention .####[]
None The Convention basically sets out the responsibility of the launching state , either jointly or collectively , for the consequences of a launch failure from the time of launching through to the re-entry of a satellite to the Earth 's atmosphere .####[]
None The Convention also sets out various claims that can be made by states who have suffered damages as a result of other states ' space projects .####[]
None As the nation most likely to suffer the impact of the Australian Space Port , Indonesia could rely on the simplest article in the Liability Convention , Section 14 .####[]
None This section allows states who have suffered damages to claim compensation through the International Claims Commission , which acts as the representative of the appellant state against the launching state ( in this case Australia ) or any other international organisation which can be classed as a launching state .####[]
None Of course , lodging a claim is not as simple as clapping one 's hands .####[]
None Indonesia at the very least needs to sign the UN Convention on Space as well as ratify several other treaties governing national activities in outer space .####[]
None These UN Conventions are the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies 1967 ( Space Treaty 1967 ) , the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects 1972 ( Liability Convention 1972 ) , and finally , the Convention on Registration of Objections launched into Outer Space 1974 ( Registration Convention 1974 ) .####[]
None So far , the Indonesian Government has only ratified the 1972 Liability Convention .####[]
None This convention only applies to space objects that fall into Indonesian sovereign territory .####[]
None Indonesia has only adopted one compensation principle , the Absolute Liability principle .####[]
None This principle means that the burden of proof that the claimant state has suffered damages does not lie on the state submitting its damages claim .####[]
None It is sufficient at law to demonstrate the fact of the damage caused as a result of the space object identified as belonging to the launching state or a state that has participated in the space object launching .####[]
None A National Space and Flight Agency working paper suggest a high degree of difficulty if Indonesia , as a state that has suffered damage , were to lodge a damages claim .####[]
None In the case of objections to the Christmas Island space station , Indonesia would need to be able to show that damage that has occurred within its territorial area was caused by space objects launched from the Christmas Island station .####[]
None This would of course require advanced technology and great cost to bring the matter to a claim submission .####[]

None Indonesia would not need to produce further evidence to substantiate its claim , he said .####[]

None These principles are upheld in the Space Treaty 1967 .####[]

None but i consider invasion of my privacy####[]
None yeah yeah####[]
None a harassment in itself####[]

None i believe we 've pretty much summed everything up####[]
None i know but i remember you you talked about something you started off and you said well let me think you talked about the telephone calls people coming and soliciting selling things at the door you said something else and i ca n't remember what it was and i thought yeah that that kind of touched a nerve right there but we got uh we got to talking about the um uh people coming to you at the front door####[]

None United States President George W. Bush finally announced his country 's proposal for fighting the greenhouse effect .####[]
None Seven months after having rejected the Kyoto Protocol because he considered it to be without scientific basis , detrimental to US economic interests , and unfair in not obliging medium-sized nations ( like Brazil and India ) to reduce their gas emissions in the same proportion as that imposed on industrialized countries , Bush made public the plan that , he promised , would not have any of the defects of the Kyoto Protocol and would achieve the same , if not better , results .####[([58, 59], [61, 63], [10], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([72, 75], [61, 63], [10], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([6, 8], [3, 6], [10], 'Negative', 'Average'), ([13], [10, 12], [10], 'Neutral', 'Weak')]
None Basically , the Bush plan makes the reduction in pollution gas emissions conditional on the Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) growth rate .####[]
None Emissions of these gases should rise at a slower pace than that of the GDP , he says .####[]
None The first problem pointed out by critics is that Bush has created a new concept , that of " greenhouse gas intensity , " which could be defined as the volume of gas emissions divided by GDP .####[]
None It is this index that will be reduced , according to the White House , by 18 percent over the next 10 years .####[]
None But what the US Government does not emphasize is that the natural tendency of the economy is for services to increase their participation in the GDP , and for industrial activities , which are the biggest energy consumers , to diminish .####[]
None Therefore , that so-called 18 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions could , in fact , represent a real increase in the absolute quantity of such gases .####[]
None Some environmental entities calculate that Bush 's plan will lead to the US 's emitting ! , in 2010 , 29 percent more greenhouse gases than it did in 1990 .####[]
None Technical arguments could go on an on , and matter little here .####[]
None More important are two indisputable conclusions , both potentially embarrassing to the Bush administration and extremely threatening to the world as a whole .####[([4, 7], [8, 11], [12, 15], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None The first is that , once again , the current US administration , faced with a controversial issue , is situating itself alongside the explicit interests of companies in the energy sector .####[]
None The long - standing ties Bush and several of his leading advisors have with these companies allow us to suppose an ultimate conflict of interests that would only increase with the government 's persistent alignment with their goals .####[([37, 39], [33, 36], [31, 33], 'Positive', 'Weak')]
None The Enron scandal is already taking a significant political toll of the Bush team , which will tend to increase .####[]
None But the consequences of the divorce between the US and the international community in the Kyoto Protocol case could be even more serious .####[]
None The second conclusion is that , contrary to what some optimists were predicting after 11 September , Bush seems to have decided to stick to a course of arrogant unilateralism when conducting his foreign policy .####[([0], [10, 12], [10, 12], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([18], [2, 4], [0], 'Neutral', 'Weak')]
None The break with Kyoto had been a pre-attack marker in the Bush administration , for having demonstrated the latter 's absolute indifference to the opinion of even its closest allies , such as Germany , France , the United Kingdom , and Japan .####[]
None After the World Trade Center and Pentagon tragedies , there were some who thought that Washington 's rapprochement with its traditional partners was inevitable , with the goal of defeating the threat of international terrorism .####[([20, 23], [17, 19], [12, 13], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None However , after a brief period of shock , Bush resumed his solitary road , as he clearly demonstrated in his State of the Union speech , in which he threatened the " Axis of Evil " countries ( Iran , Iraq , and North Korea ) without consulting the Europeans and Japanese , who do not necessarily agree with the appropriateness of antagonizing the governments of those nations .####[]
None The announcement of a plan that is supposedly an alternative to the Kyoto Protocol , but which in practice rejects it in a way that cannot be taken seriously by the countries who committed themselves to it ( among which is Brazil ) , only deserves rejection in response and to provoke in retrospect an enormous concern about what the only world superpower intends in future .####[([22, 23], [19, 21], [0], 'Negative', 'Average'), ([59, 67], [55, 57], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None These days , the Israeli government is adopting a relatively new tactic regarding its plan to withdraw from the Palestinian cities and towns that it had re-occupied more than three weeks ago .####[]
None It is not implementing an immediate and total withdrawal -- as demanded by the international community as a whole and the United States in particular -- but a phased and partial withdrawal .####[([5, 10], [11, 13], [14, 24], 'Neutral', 'Strong')]
None It does not leave any city or town except after reaching what it calls a security agreement with the Palestinian side for a cease -fire in that particular city or town .####[]
None The Israeli Government hopes that this tactic would eventually lead to an integrated and total agreement when all its parts are put together to form a map of " cantons " that Israel envisions for the occupied Palestinian lands .####[([18, 40], [33, 35], [32, 33], 'Neutral', 'Average'), ([6, 17], [4, 5], [1, 3], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None Israel says that it carried out this tactic in Bethlehem and Bayt Jala , or so it claims , and yesterday , it claimed that it carried out the same tactic in Qalqiliyah when the Palestinian security forces returned to the three centers that had been re-occupied by the invading Israeli forces .####[]
None The Israeli press and other media outlets point out that future withdrawals from the cities parts of which are still under Israeli occupation will be carried out in accordance to this tactic of phased and partial withdrawal .####[]
None Israel seems to think that this tactic will circumvent the Palestinian move toward independence and will put an end to the Palestinian intifadah by surrounding the areas of tension and dealing with them separately .####[]
None The facts show that this Israeli tactic is new only in execution .####[]
None Talking about it and about its possible use are several months old and , more exactly , they have been going on since the Israeli Government headed by Ari'el Sharon came to power about nine months ago .####[]
None This tactic is no more than an improved carbon copy of the style of " divide and rule . "####[]
None It actually reflects Israel 's determination not to deal with the Palestinian issue as one united and indivisible whole .####[]
None The inevitable result of this tactic -- if it succeeds in temporarily calming down the situation -- is that it will take back conditions to their former state of tension after the withdrawals are completed from all the Palestinian cities .####[]
None The core of the matter is not in the method that Israel is using to crush the Palestinian moves and confiscate the will of the Palestinian people for liberation and independence .####[([28, 32], [23, 24], [25, 28], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None The core of the matter lies in a just and acceptable political framework that Israel is supposed to approve and participate in to put a final end to the occupation and to the settlement construction activities .####[]
None Such a political framework would lay the firm foundations for a comprehensive peace based on justice and recognition of the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people .####[]
None Only such a peace can bring security and stability to all the parties without exception .####[]
None This being the case , it would be better for both Israel and the Palestinians to have an immediate and parallel Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied parts of several Palestinian cities .####[]
None Only such an immediate and parallel withdrawal would expedite the return to serious negotiations between the two sides based on the reference point of ending the occupation , ending settlement construction activities , and restoring the full inalienable rights of the Palestinian people .####[]

None Polly Peck International Inc. 's agreement to acquire 51 % of Sansui Electric Co. proves that foreign companies can acquire Japanese companies -- if the alternative for the Japanese company is extinction .####[]
None Polly Peck , a fast- growing British conglomerate , will pay 15.6 billion yen ( $ 110 million ) for 39 million new shares of Sansui , a well - known maker of high-fidelity audio equipment that failed to adjust to changing market conditions .####[]
None Japanese government officials , eager to rebut foreign criticism of Japanese investments overseas , hailed the transaction as proof foreigners can make similar investments in Japan .####[([6, 10], [5, 6], [0, 4], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None Polly Peck 's chairman , Asil Nadir , echoed the official Japanese view of the accord , which was announced Friday .####[]
None " The myths that Japan is not open to concerns from outside has , I think , been demolished at a stroke , " Mr. Nadir said .####[]
None But analysts say Sansui is a special case .####[]
None It expects to post a loss of 6.4 billion yen for the year ending tomorrow and its liabilities currently exceed its assets by about 13.8 billion yen .####[]
None " If you find sound , healthy companies in Japan , they are not for sale , " said George Watanabe , a management - consultant at Tokyo - based Asia Advisory Services Inc .####[]
None Statistics on acquisitions by foreigners vary in detail , because unlike Sansui , which is listed on the Tokyo and Osaka stock exchanges , most of the Japanese companies acquired by foreigners are privately held .####[]
None But by all accounts foreign companies have bought only a relative handful of Japanese companies this year , while Japanese companies have acquired hundreds of foreign companies .####[]
None Nor do analysts expect the Sansui deal to touch off a fresh wave of foreign purchases .####[]
None If the strong yen and the high stock prices of Japanese companies were n't deterrents enough , webs of cross-shareholdings between friendly Japanese companies and fiercely independent Japanese corporate attitudes repel most would - be acquirers .####[]
None Usually when a Japanese company is ready to sell , it has few alternatives remaining , and the grim demeanors of Sansui 's directors at a joint news conference here left little doubt that this was not the company 's finest hour .####[([0], [19, 21], [21, 26], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None Sansui was once one of Japan 's premier makers of expensive , high -quality stereo gear for audiophiles .####[]
None But in recent years , the market has moved toward less expensive " mini-component " sets , miniaturized amplifiers and receivers and software players that could be stacked on top of each other .####[]
None Some of Sansui 's fellow audio-specialty companies , such as Aiwa Co. and Pioneer Electric Corp. , responded to the challenge by quickly bringing out mini-component products of their own , by moving heavily into the booming compact disk businesses or by diversifying into other consumer -electronics fields , including laser disks or portable cassette players .####[]
None Sansui was late into the mini-component business and failed to branch into other new businesses .####[]
None As the yen soared in recent years , Sansui 's deepening financial problems became a vicious circle .####[]
None While competitors moved production offshore in response to the sagging competitiveness of Japanese factories , Sansui lacked the money to build new plants in Southeast Asia .####[]
None " Our company has not been able to cope very effectively with " changes in the marketplace , said Ryosuke Ito , Sansui 's president .####[]
None But even a Japanese company that looks like a dog may turn out to be a good investment for a foreign concern , some management consultants maintain .####[]
None Yoshihisa Murasawa , a management consultant for Booz-Allen & Hamilton ( Japan ) Inc. , said his firm will likely be recommending acquisitions of Japanese companies more often to foreign clients in the future .####[]
None " Attitudes { toward being acquired } are still negative , but they 're becoming more positive , " Mr. Murasawa said .####[([5, 8], [3], [20, 22], 'Neutral', 'Weak'), ([5, 8], [3], [20, 22], 'Neutral', 'Weak')]
None " In some industries , like pharmaceuticals , acquisitions make sense . "####[]
None Whether Polly Peck 's acquisition makes sense remains to be seen , but at the news conference , Mr. Nadir brimmed with self -confidence that he can turn Sansui around .####[]
None Sansui , he said , is a perfect fit for Polly Peck 's electronics operations , which make televisions , videocassette recorders , microwaves and other products on an " original equipment maker " basis for sale under other companies ' brand names .####[([3], [6, 7], [4, 5], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None He said Polly Peck will greatly expand Sansui 's product line , using Sansui 's engineers to design the new products , and will move Sansui 's production of most products other than sophisticated audio gear offshore into Polly Peck 's own factories .####[]
None " Whatever capital it ( Sansui ) needs so it can compete and become a totally global entity capable of competing with the best in the world , that capital will be injected , " Mr. Nadir said .####[]
None And while Polly Peck is n't jettisoning the existent top-management structure of Sansui , it is bringing in a former Toshiba Corp .####[([8, 12], [6, 8], [4, 6], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None executive as executive vice president and chief operating officer .####[]
None Such risk taking is an everyday matter for the brash Mr. Nadir , who is 25 % owner of Polly Peck as well as its chairman .####[]
None He took Polly Peck , once a small fabric wholesaler , and used it at as a base to build a conglomerate that has been doubling its profits annually since 1980 .####[]
None In September , it announced plans to acquire the tropical - fruit business of RJR Nabisco Inc. 's Del Monte foods unit for # 557 million ( $ 878 million ) .####[]
None Last month , Polly Peck posted a 38 % jump in pretax profit for the first half to # 54.8 million from # 39.8 million on a 63 % rise in sales .####[]

None The first railway in outer space was ready to roll yesterday after astronauts from the space shuttle Atlantis prepped it for its inaugural run .####[]
None The rail car , installed outside the International Space Station on the crew 's first spacewalk , will have a top speed of just three centimetres per second , but ground controllers may not open up the throttle all the way in their first test today anyway .####[]
None The rail car is part of the 13 - metre-long S-0 truss , the centerpiece of what is to be a 120 - metre girder running the length of the space station .####[]
None The completed girder will support thousands of square metres of solar panels generating power for use throughout the station .####[]
None In a spacewalk lasting more than six hours , astronauts Steve Smith and Rex Walheim , the same team that mounted the new truss segment on to the station last Thursday , released launch restraints on the rail car , which rode to space in the shuttle 's cargo bay .####[]
None NASA said the Mobile Transporter , as the rail car is officially known , was ready for its first test today .####[]
None " As far as speed is concerned , it 's probably going to be in the fractions of an inch velocity -- on the order of a tenth of an inch per second , " said Ben Sellari , the launch package manager at Mission Control .####[]
None The small trolley is designed to roll the station 's Canadarm2 robotic arm from one construction site to another as work progresses on the station over the next several years .####[]
None Captain Marc Garneau , president of the Canadian Space Agency , said Canadarm2 has so far performed flawlessly in its pivotal role installing the truss segment .####[]
None The massive robotic arm , Canada 's contribution to the multi-national space station , lifted the truss segment out and away from the shuttle 's cargo bay and attached it on the station 's laboratory module .####[]
None The arm was then used for the first time to move the spacewalking astronauts to different work sites around the newly installed truss .####[]
None Teams of engineers from the CSA and MD Robotics , the Brampton - based company that built the arm , were monitoring its work closely from the ground .####[]
None An anomaly was detected on one of its joints several weeks ago , but the Canadian engineers successfully bypassed the problem area .####[]

None A cow grazing near the village of Meresti [ Harghita County ] was bitten by a fox suffering from rabies .####[]
None As a consequence , the cow was infected as well .####[]
None This is the first such case here , and the third one since 1999 .####[]
None The symptoms appeared within a few days .####[]
None The owner though that the animal was suffering from some intoxication , which was confirmed also by the veterinarian called to examine the cow .####[]
None Very soon , however , the symptoms indicated that it was suffering from rabies : it was banging its head against the crib and it was very restless .####[]
None The owner put down the animal , although the vet had forbidden him to do so .####[]
None The latter took the cow 's head to a lab , where they found that it had been suffering from rabies .####[]
None The owner and a neighbor who had helped him put down the animal were sent urgently to the Hospital for Infectious Diseases in Miercurea Ciuc , where they received preventive anti-rabies treatment .####[]
None The carcass of the cow was burned and buried , and the stable was disinfected .!####[]
