NA " A bit less than that , " was the answer .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA " There you see !####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA The Soviet Union can launch ambassador Liu Xiao into space !####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA America cannot do it so far . "####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Was it only the wish of socialist propaganda in those words ?####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA That speech was delivered on November 15 , 1957 , and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China authorized its rocket production program a year before that , in October of 1956 ( on Mao Tse-tung 's initiative ) .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA The specialized Fifth Institute of the Defense Ministry was established for that purpose .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Two years ago , in October of 1955 , Beijing received a person with the reputation of the " Chinese Korolev " Qian Xuesen , who came to China from the USA , where he had settled after graduating from Shanghai university , so it would be better to call him " Chinese von Broun . "####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Xuesen continued his studies at California Technical University , having obtained a Doctor of Astronautics degree , and , as the say , the title of US Air Force colonel .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA He then was employed at a US Air Force rocket engine lab and succeeded there .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA In the summer of 1950 , he made an attempt to move to Beijing .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA FBI agents caught him and his wife at the airport of Los Angeles , as well as luggage that contained 896 pounds of books and records .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Xuesen was released only after five years only , after the " quarantine " during which he was not allowed access to the secret information .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Xuesen became the supervisor of the research works in the field , but the Chinese spaceships of the Shenzhou type looked like the Russian Soyuz , specialists say .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA At the same time , when the Chinese von Broun managed to reach China , there were other bearers of fresher secrets there from the country , which could " launch ambassador Liu Xiao into space . "####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA China 's three ( unmanned ) spaceships were launched into space from there :####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA Shenzhou - 3 ( blasted off on March 25 ) stayed in space for the same period of time , with the same number of circuits around the Earth .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA The current goal is to examine the module and its contents ( like in the first two cases ) .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA However , it is evident now that China has reliable rocket systems ; it has mastered the art of space navigation and soft landing of a spaceship .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA Their training is in full swing ( Russia is reportedly participating ) .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA As China 's experts believe , there should be at least four test unmanned flights performed before they can launch a man into space .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA By A Special Correspondent - Britain's Prime Minister , Tony Blair , privately did two things concerning Zimbabwe during the recent " retreat " by Commonwealth leaders in Australia that raise questions about today 's meeting in London by the troika of Australia , Nigeria and South Africa .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA The first was that Blair said he had received an interim report from the Commonwealth observer mission to Zimbabwe that condemned the outcome of the presidential election - before Zimbabweans had even had a chance to vote .####[([22, 27], [21], [5], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
NA But how could Blair have " a Commonwealth report " when no one else had received such a report that should be channeled through the Secretariat to all members , asked one of the other 53 Commonwealth leaders at the retreat ?####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA The British leader fudged his reply and the Commonwealth leaders were left with the distinct impression that the " Blair report " had already been written in London before the Commonwealth mission even left for Zimbabwe .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Their mission was simply to rubber stamp the adverse report that Britain had already written .####[([0], [9, 10], [12], 'Negative', 'Weak')]
NA Blair 's second faux pas in Australia , according to some of the assembled Commonwealth leaders , came in his response to a remarkably conciliatory speech by Zimbabwe 's Foreign Minister , Dr Stan Mudenge .####[([0], [25, 26], [33, 35], 'Positive', 'Average')]
NA The Nigerian leader , President Olusegun Obasanjo , had urged the minister not to attack Blair frontally over Britain 's negative position regarding Zimbabwe , but to deal with the presidential election preparations in a dispassionate and precise manner .####[([24], [21, 22], [19], 'Negative', 'Weak'), ([16], [14, 15], [5, 7], 'Negative', 'Strong'), ([11, 39], [9, 10], [5, 7], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([15, 24], [9, 10], [5, 7], 'Positive', 'Average')]

NA Then Mudenge proposed that Britain and Zimbabwe bury past differences and work together in the future .####[([5], [3], [2], 'Neutral', 'Weak')]
NA The Commonwealth leaders , many of them in the first place unable to understand the dispute between Zimbabwe and its former coloniser , Britain , breathed a collective sigh of relief at what they hoped was the beginning of the healing process .####[([33, 42], [26, 31], [1, 3], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([0], [26, 31], [1, 3], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([0], [16], [18, 24], 'Negative', 'Weak'), ([36, 42], [35], [1, 3], 'Positive', 'Average')]

NA On the spurious grounds that the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front ( Zanu - PF ) election campaign centre was in an adjoining building , the Commonwealth observers moved out to the privately owned Meikles Hotel .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA During the 2000 parliamentary elections , 80 rooms at Meikles Hotel were booked by the British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA It is notable that the Commonwealth observer mission did not move again although the opposition had now joined them in the same hotel .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA There was also the curious appointment of and behaviour by individual members of the Commonwealth mission who should have been sworn to secrecy as part of their mission and who should have expressed their views only through the chair of the mission .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Instead , an Australian member of the Federal Parliament , Julie Bishop , vented her anger towards the President and Government , and the electoral process , in Australia 's media .####[([18, 26], [14, 16], [11, 12], 'Negative', 'Strong')]

NA The final straw that confirmed that Australia had abandoned any pretence of fairness to all sides in the dispute came when the Australian Prime Minister , John Howard , ordered his High Commissioner in Harare not to attend Sunday 's inauguration of Robert Mugabe as President of Zimbabwe .####[([0], [8, 11], [7], 'Neutral', 'Average'), ([0], [19], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
NA The Australians , in common with other white members of the Commonwealth , the European Union ( EU ) , the Americans , Norwegians and the Swiss stayed away from that event saying they do not recognise the election and therefore Mugabe as the head of State .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA PRESIDENT GEORGE Bush 's National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice has recently " defined " the context and scope of the term " axis of evil " that Bush used in his State of the Union address a few weeks ago to describe Iraq , Iran and North Korea .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA The criteria set by Rice are the following : the three countries in question are repressive and grave human rights violators , and aggressively seeking weapons of mass destruction .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA By all conservative estimates , there are scores of other countries which can easily qualify as repressive and violating human rights .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA The rule , as far as human rights are concerned , is that every nation which does not enjoy pluralistic democracy is violating human rights and is therefore oppressive .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA There are many countries in the world that hardly qualify as pluralistic democracies .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA On this count , the national security adviser may have erred .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA As for her wording regarding acquisition of weapons , what is particularly noteworthy is the use of the words " aggressively seeking " nuclear , biological or chemical weapons .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA In other words , countries which are seeking or developing such arsenal at a slow pace do not seem to come within the scope of the " axis of evil " .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA One can name more than a dozen countries which are contemplating the acquisition of mass destruction weapons at one speed or another .####[([12, 17], [10, 11], [4, 8], 'Neutral', 'Weak')]
NA All other countries which are seemingly refraining from acquiring such weapons are doing so not so much to escape being branded as " evil " but rather because they have neither the knowledge nor the money to join the " nuclear club " .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Come to think of it , acquiring weapons of mass destruction per se may not be a correct basis for judging whether a nation is good or evil .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA The mere development or possession of mass destruction weapons is not in itself a reason to label a state as evildoer .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA Moreover , the US is the first and only nation ever to deploy such weapons .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Perhaps the real criterion in this context is whether the nuclear country is democratic in every sense of the word .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Washington seems to be particularly disturbed and feel that its own national security is being threatened only when the nations which acquire mass destruction weapons are authoritarian or repressive , irrespective of the pace of amassing weaponry .####[([18, 29], [5, 6], [1], 'Negative', 'Strong'), ([18, 29], [8], [1], 'Negative', 'Average')]

NA The conference in New York , which dealt with a ban on demand for light arms , and the Genoa Conference which had a much wider and extended agenda , had two common features between them .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA Critics of the meeting , on the margin of the conference , up held the view that the American government , instead of heeding the wishes of international community , and protecting the security of world nations , and above all the safety of its own citizens , has paid more attention to the interests of corporations and huge arms producers and military - industrial complexes that reap tremendous profits annually from the sale of such armaments .####[([0], [26], [1, 4], 'Neutral', 'Average'), ([18, 20], [13, 16], [1, 4], 'Neutral', 'Average')]

NA In the remarks made by these political leaders , one point is interesting and calls for reflection : if these leaders reject the interference of others in the condition and destiny of the poor nations , while present themselves legitimate and competent to make far reaching decisions for them , then it must be said that they are only the elected [ leaders ] of their own nation [ people ] , and this does not entitle them to act as representative or legal attorney of all people worldwide !####[([23, 35], [22], [20, 21], 'Negative', 'Weak')]
NA [ Exclamation mark as published ]####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA At the Bonn Conference too , the agenda was to tackle and discuss the most urgent and indispensable factors concerning the life of humankind .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA The remarkable feature of this conference was the joint resolution adopted by 180 countries worldwide --- in regard to protection of environment , and above all reducing the emission of greenhouse gases --- , which has isolated America in an undeniable way .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA It was due to this isolation that America , in spite of discrediting [ undermining ] the Kyoto Protocol and declining to comply with the Bonn Conference [ resolution ] , was forced to at least make a promise to cooperate in preventing an increase in air pollution .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA To recap , if there ever existed any possibility that at the conferences of New York and Genoa questions regarding : promotion of world security , improvement of economic conditions , defusing regional and global crises and conflicts , checking unleashed competition for rearmament , reduction of the gap between the mainstream and peripheral countries , and ... could be addressed and appropriate , serious , and worthy measures for their solution could be adopted , the opportunity was very easily lost and the meetings flopped completely .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA As regards the recent conference ( Bonn Meeting ) , although the past gatherings like the Hague meeting and Kyoto conference have proved to be failed experiences , nevertheless as the climatic and atmospheric crises are growing more serious , one can be optimistic and hopeful about the success of such protocols and pacts , and implementation of the agreements , even though they are not protected by any sanctions .####[([48, 60], [44, 46], [41], 'Positive', 'Average')]

NA United States President George W. Bush finally announced his country 's proposal for fighting the greenhouse effect .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Seven months after having rejected the Kyoto Protocol because he considered it to be without scientific basis , detrimental to US economic interests , and unfair in not obliging medium-sized nations ( like Brazil and India ) to reduce their gas emissions in the same proportion as that imposed on industrialized countries , Bush made public the plan that , he promised , would not have any of the defects of the Kyoto Protocol and would achieve the same , if not better , results .####[([58], [62], [10], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([72, 74], [62], [10], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([6, 8], [4, 5], [10], 'Negative', 'Average'), ([12], [11], [10], 'Neutral', 'Weak')]
NA Basically , the Bush plan makes the reduction in pollution gas emissions conditional on the Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) growth rate .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Emissions of these gases should rise at a slower pace than that of the GDP , he says .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA The first problem pointed out by critics is that Bush has created a new concept , that of " greenhouse gas intensity , " which could be defined as the volume of gas emissions divided by GDP .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA It is this index that will be reduced , according to the White House , by 18 percent over the next 10 years .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA But what the US Government does not emphasize is that the natural tendency of the economy is for services to increase their participation in the GDP , and for industrial activities , which are the biggest energy consumers , to diminish .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Therefore , that so-called 18 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions could , in fact , represent a real increase in the absolute quantity of such gases .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA The announcement of a plan that is supposedly an alternative to the Kyoto Protocol , but which in practice rejects it in a way that cannot be taken seriously by the countries who committed themselves to it ( among which is Brazil ) , only deserves rejection in response and to provoke in retrospect an enormous concern about what the only world superpower intends in future .####[([21], [20], [0], 'Negative', 'Average'), ([59, 66], [56, 57], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
