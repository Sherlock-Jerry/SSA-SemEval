NA American intellectual Noam Chomsky has proved in his writings that the accomplishment of its goals by aggression and terrorism is a part of the American psyche .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA This can be traced back to the events in 1818 , when American cowboys used blind force to oppress the blacks .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Since then , the United States has been raising artificial slogans of preservation of democracy and human rights and developing standards of living .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA It has been clearly mentioned in various documents including the US National Security Council memorandum number 68 issued in 1950 , that US supremacy has to be maintained at any cost .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA It can be derived from this that the US attack on Afghanistan without any logic , was not an impulsive action but the psychology of maintaining US supremacy was fully involved in it .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA It is possible that the United States itself planned this suicidal attack .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA It is due to this hegemony , which the United States wants to maintain , that its State Department makes an assessment of the human rights situation in different countries and prepares a report on their violations all over the world .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA The United States has never tried to make a self-assessment .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA The weekly said that mainland China has attracted more than US $ 50 billion in investment from Taiwan thus far , while the Taipei authorities bowed to pressure from its own businessmen to lift restrictions on investment in mainland China in May , a move expected to speed up the flow of Taiwan capital to its arch rival .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA Some of the participants took the line that this is an extremely useful for Russia , which has " hot air " ( that is , it is 30 percent short of the permitted level of CO2 emissions ) , and the country can become the dominant seller in the market ; consequently , it has a greater stake than anyone in the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA We will also gain from the fact that compliance by other nations with the terms of the protocol will lead to higher demand for gas , of which we have huge resources .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA The Kyoto mechanism is costly , but its value lies in the fact that its implementation has been tied to the market mechanism , that is , life without change has been made uneconomical . "####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA Consequently , if our homeland 's efforts boil down merely to dealing in " hot air , " this will not provide an impetus to start up high technologies and will knock Russia out of the group of countries that are striving for rational development , above all out of the European Union .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA In Russia , up to 98 percent of all emissions of the main greenhouse gas -- CO2 -- come from the burning of fossil fuels ( coal , oil , gas ) .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA This means the problem of reducing emissions is a problem of energy efficiency and energy saving .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA We are not required to reduce emissions , but over five years ( from 2008 through 2012 ) we do not have the right to exceed their volume .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA This is substantiated in detail in the RF Energy Strategy Until 2020 , which the government has adopted .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA Get a life .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA The chronic complainers are outraged by , of all things , the treatment of the captured Taliban and al Qaeda terrorists being detained at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA They have absurdly criticized as " inhumane " the decision to temporarily place prison suits , handcuffs and blindfolds on the terrorists during transfer to protect the military personnel guarding them .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA They have even demanded upgraded accommodations , seemingly forgetting that these are the leaders of a worldwide terrorist organization who have repeatedly vowed to kill innocent Americans through war or terror .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Far from being treated inhumanely , the al Qaeda and the Taliban terrorists are better fed , better clothed and better cared for than they would be if they were still roaming the cold caves of Afghanistan .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA They eat three nutritious meals a day , including halal , cereal and granola bars .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA They enjoy their own large cell , talking freely with one another , worshiping with a prayer leader , and writing home .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA It seems our critics would prefer that the Taliban and al Qaeda terrorists instead stay at the Ritz-Carlton .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA By way of contrast , the men and women of our military who have the extremely dangerous job of guarding these thugs live in 12 - person tents , take cold showers using a hose , and often must cope without the benefits of electricity .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA They have been away from home for months , and they serve our nation with dignity and honor .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA Scientists believe these ``greenhouse '' gases ( GHG ) , which mainly result from burning fossil fuels , raise the earth 's temperature and change the climate by creating floods , droughts , and other abnormal weather phenomena .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
