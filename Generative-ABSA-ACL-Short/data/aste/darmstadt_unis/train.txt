None Graduate Student : I'm enrolled in one of DeVry's graduate level programs .####[]
None I thought it would be easy , but have found just the opposite .####[([3], [12, 14], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None In reviewing information from other graduate programs [U-of-H and Texas A-M] , DeVry appears to be requiring you to delivery similar work to the traditional classroom study at these campuses .####[]
None My suggestion to anyone evaluating DeVry programs , is to checkout a few other universities before deciding .####[]
None You might be surprised to find out that DeVry is not a push over .####[([9, 10], [12], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None Good luck in any decision you make .####[]
None Instructors are not consistent from class to class on requirements for grades .####[([0, 2], [3], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]

None I have been an online student for two trimesters now and the professors were very good .####[([12, 14], [15, 16], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None At first they seemed a little pompus , but as the trimester continued they were much more helpfull .####[([14, 15], [16, 17], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None I took two classes and I spent more time on reading assignments and homework than I ever did at traditional colleges .####[]
None However , I do feel that I learned the material better .####[]
None The insight coaches were also great .####[([2, 4], [6, 7], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None The only problem I had was the fact that financial aid called every week of the trimester and still screwed my bill up .####[([9, 11], [2], [0], 'Negative', 'Weak')]
None It was easily corrected by my advisor , but it upset me greatly .####[([1, 2], [2, 5], [0], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([10], [12, 14], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None The school has a good name and from the instructors I had they deserve it . . .####[([5, 7], [13, 17], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None As a very short lived former student with Western International University let me say the following : ( a ) the school is a joke ( but then again it's an heir of the UOP ; ( b ) Financial Aid is truly a joke ; ( c ) My enrollment Advisor is nowhere to be found ; ( d ) I have been told nothing but " unusual " lies I've never heard of in an educational environment ; ( e ) They talk a good game until they get you in and then they think they have you hooked ; ( f ) It took darned near 4 weeks into a 9 week program before my academic advisor contacted me ; ( g ) They literally provide you with the paperwork which clearly implicates their " unusual " practices ; ( h ) They assume you know no better than to believe their B.S . ; ( i ) I reported them to a division of the DOE inturn , the DOE representatives have contacted the Financial Aid Office of Theft on several occasions regarding my case .####[([21, 24], [25, 26], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]

None I graduated from AIU online with a BIT Programming .####[]
None I decided to finish my education with a online school after 8 years of attending a State Uni .####[]
None I had a serious problem with the state uni , I was never able to get into any of my classes , due to time constraints , I worked fulltime all the way through school , and because freshman had priority on all GE classes .####[]
None What this equaled was 8 years of college , all GEs except math complete and my major classes were never scheduled so I could attend .####[]
None I ended up taking 2 classes a semester because I due to the state colleges bureaucracy I was never able to find or enroll in classes that would work with a fulltime schedule .####[]
None My biggest fear was that if I ever finished school I would never even use my degree , after all , at the time I was working in a retail store with several college grads doing the same thing as me .####[]
None I entered AIU with a beginners level in computers .####[]
None I had worked with some programming but not much .####[]
None The classes were laid out in a progressive manner , as with math you need to have a foundation before you can start building on it and AIU took this into account .####[([1, 3], [7, 8], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None My instructors were well versed in the subjects they taught and had just as many if not more office hours than , my State Uni , that they could be approached for help .####[([1, 3], [4, 6], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None Because it is an accelerated program the classes move fast and it is very easy to fall behind .####[([7, 9], [14, 15], [0], 'Neutral', 'Strong'), ([7, 9], [10, 11], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None If you are considering AIU you will need to be ready to apply yourself in order to get the work done , because no room for procrastinators here !####[]
None The course work was very challenging and I really walked away from this school with an education I can apply to my everyday life .####[([1, 4], [5], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None I am even working a job now where I use skills that are directly related to my degree and lessons I learned at AIU .####[]
None How many other people can say that as well ?####[]
None I have not started with Devry yet but I do this year .####[]
None So far it seems great especially for someone like me , a full-time employee .####[([3], [5], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None I am very fortunate and almost right out of high school with a very average GPA and only 20 ; I already make above $45,000 a year as a programmer with a large health care company for over a year and have had 3 promotions up in the first year and a half .####[]
None I decided that I want to go ahead and get a bachelors in CIS so I will not be capped in my salary and companies can not use my lack of an education as leverage to pay me cheap .####[]
None Many people are knocking Devry but I have seen them to be a very great school for people who really push themselves .####[([5, 6], [14], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong'), ([5, 6], [3, 4], [1, 3], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None I've already asked my HR department if a Devry degree is credible and here was the answer : " If you earned you education , its credible . "####[]
None With further communication with my HR department I've come to the conclusion that if you didn't just purchase your degree but you earned it by learning and expressing your skill and abilities you and your degree are credible to any company .####[]
None If a company does not accept my degree , without seeing my ability I would not want to work for such a bias company .####[]
None Keep in mind my company is strict in every process especially being a Public traded company that complies with the all the public company acts .####[]
None The only reason I would see Devry not being credible is totally dependent on the student .####[]
None Its all on you , not the paper you have .####[]
None If I can get the job at college-graduate starting salaries , plus 3 promotions in a year without any degree from any school and just a dimploma , I know without any doubt that with a degree from Devry I can move around and have better leverage with other companies .####[]
None From what I saw and hear , you surely earn your degree at Devry , you must pass the class with a C to earn the credits , its only a year shorter than a typical 4 year program at a local college , and such a fast-paced career-oriented education is offered .####[([14, 15], [47, 48], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None If you want to go to college to receive that " college-life " or to get the " personality " , " character " , etc that a college campus and life gives you then go to a local university or high-held prestige school .####[]
None But if you already know your career path , already have character and pesonality in your life , then Devry is a good option to consider .####[]
None I plan on going to their Keller graduate school to get an MBA after my bachelors because on year of your bachelors counts for one year of earning your masters and so you only have one year left to finish your masters !####[]
None I hated community college .####[]
None It was so bland and the classes were huge ( 30 students or more sometimes ) and the teachers were awful .####[]
None I've noticed that the successful students at Devry are brilliant , goal-oriented people and know exactly what they are aiming for .####[([5, 7], [11, 12], [0], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([5, 7], [9, 11], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]

None It depends on your goals , yourself , your direction , your career , etc .####[]
None As the president of the ASB at the Long Beach campus I have had very many mixed feelings when it comes to DeVry . . . Im a 7th term Computer Engineering Technology major and I really think that devry has kind of gone through alot of problems ever since their " hay-day " back in the mid-late ninties...for any prospective students , here is my pro/con list for you : //----------------------------- // // PROS // //----------------------------- ---small class sizes , on the average your classes will have between 6 - 15 students . . . usually on the smaller side .####[([79, 82], [77, 78], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None that doesnt sound like much , but even if your professor sucks , at least hes only ten feet away rather than 400 in a lecture hall ---expedient education devry uses a trimester based system , which means that you only have 6 weeks off for the whole year ; however , you graduate in three if you take the standard course load of 17.68 units per tri ---abet/tac accreditation devry has had accreditation for a long time now and here at the long beach campus , abet tac gave us the longest accreditation that they offer .####[([28, 29], [27, 28], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None ---job placement i had two friends last semester that graduated with 3.5 and 3.9 and both were offered engineering positions that offered their starting pay at 50k and 65k respectively there are tons of jobs for us CET's and EET's...that if you work hard in them your looking at 6-figure salaries within 10 years easily //----------------------------- // // CONS // //----------------------------- ---bad profs while almost every school has em....we seem to draw them like flies .####[([63], [61, 62], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None ive had well over half of my classes taught by completely ridiculous professors , some of which truly puzzled me as to how anyone in the world could actually hire this person ---incompetent administration sometimes i truly am amazed whenever i have to visit any of the various departments , particularly student finance .####[([12, 14], [10, 11], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong'), ([33, 34], [32, 33], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None the experience that i have when i visit student finance is much like going to the dentist , except when i leave , nothing is ever fixed , and i am always angrier than when i entered .####[([9, 11], [12, 13], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None ---business run academic institution alot of the decisions as to classes are made with a business mentality when they should be made with an educational one .####[]
None course changes , student activites , even outsourcing the bookstore are all run with a business-like , bottom-line driven mentality ---the cost i dont even need to explain this one ; however let me tell you that if you actually read the quarterly reports that are sent to devry's stakeholders , you will find the following in thier recent statistics : online , night time , and weekend enrollment is up 29% from last year while full-time day student enrollment is down porportionally .####[]
None this tells us one of two things either students are switching from daytime to the others , or new students are coming as fast as the old ones are leaving .####[]
None why would they do this ? its MUCH cheaper to attend any other way than full-time mind you it will probably take 2 to 4 times longer to fulfill your degree requirements .####[]
None //------------------------- // // Conclusion // //------------------------- DeVry is the school model of the future ; for better or worse .####[]
None DeVry educates over 200,000 people across the nation .####[]
None DeVry started itself as a technical training facility for radio technicians in the 1930's .####[]
None Many of the first courses taught were done so under " top secret " security clearances , and at the time were the most cutting edge training anyone could get .####[]
None If DeVry is going to reclaim it's position as the best technical education out there , it MUST refocus its efforts back to its roots , and strengthen them with all of its force .####[]
None DeVry must cut it's fluff....trim the fat !####[]
None get rid of all the ridiculus programs that we have no facilities for ; namely the GSP , HMIT , BMET , BMI , etc.etc .####[([6, 8], [5, 6], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None DeVry is a technical university and we have some of the best labs for CET , EET , ECT , even NCM students .####[]
None We have the capability to become a great institution of HIGHER education , but only if we stop pandereing to the greed-filled marketing strategies of beurocratic buisinessmen !####[]
None I too experienced CTU as an instructor for one and only one semester .####[]
None I thought they were only concerned about making money and not the education .####[]

None I have not been , nor will I ever be , a student at capella , but what everyone on this forum seems to be forgetting , or at least ignorant of , is the fact that the APA will not accredit capella so all of you out there who are getting the PhD in Psych , beware .####[]
None I have over all been VERY impressed with CTU , I feel where people are messed up is when they try to rely on this degree to get them a job ( putting in no effort ) , or they enroll with out ANY experience in the field .####[([10, 11], [6], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None These same people dont know the basics of have to operate a computer .####[]
None The one thing I wish is that CTU had a stricter acceptance policy .####[([8, 9], [5, 6], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None If someone cannot pass a basic computer navigation course , they cant enroll , or if they cant pass a simple pre-exam for their chosen degree they cant enroll .####[]
None If you dont know ANYTHING about the degree field you are wanting to go into , or you dont know ANYTHING about basic computer operations .####[]
None DONT ENROLL .####[]
None 90% of these negative reviews sound like people that are just pissed because they cant learn without having their hands held .####[]
None This college is for people that are self motivated and WANT a degree , not for people that want to goof off and have the instructor remind them day after day what they need to do and walk then all the way through gradation .####[([1, 3], [3, 4], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None It shocks me that half of the people that degrade this college can hardly type a crappy review without misspellings , errors and just plain stupidity .####[([11, 13], [9, 11], [7, 9], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None Maybe it has nothing to do with your " personal experiences " , maybe you ought to look beyond your crappy day at the student finances office .####[([24, 28], [20, 22], [20], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None As I read through each and everyone of these reviews , the negatives leaned towards stating the exact same crap , while the positives actually made some valid points ( while still including a few negatives ) .####[]
None It surprises me that most of you could even pass the CPT , and if you didn't then yes , you are going to learn some remedial crap .####[]
None That's the name of the game .####[]
None As for everyone that makes a point to say how " Devry is only out for the money " , and I'm forced to paraphrase , since most of these comments were spelled wrong , WELCOME TO COLLEGE .####[]
None Do you think that any university is not there for the money ?####[]
None Do you think any teacher is not there for the money ?####[]
None Do you think the people that work at Yale wake up and say , " Hey , I can't wait to help some students " ?####[]
None You are sadly mistaken .####[]

None Devry has had an incredible impact on me , and I can only hope that I succeed and graduate .####[([5, 7], [4, 5], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]

None A community college .####[]
None Yes , you are thinking what do I know , I only attended a community college .####[]
None Well , I may not have experience when it comes to different colleges , but maybe that is your flaw .####[]
None Pick something .####[]
None Don't crap-talk a school , that I'm sure half of you have either flunked out of , or realized early on that you couldn't cut it in , just because your angry .####[]
None I have not once had a problem contacting anyone that I needed to contact .####[([7, 8], [3, 4], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]

None The constant negative controversy surrounding Capella and other institutions of this type is deserved .####[([5, 7], [2, 3], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None They are not really " non traditional " excellent institutions as much as they are advertising savvy businesses .####[]
None They seek out and use four types of students : 1 ) students who are not very adept at finding good institutions , 2 ) students who doubt their own abilities , 3 ) student who cannot overcome the psychological barrier of being outside of perceived mainstream systems , and students who want a simple way out of the challenge of good competitive educational excellence .####[([1, 2], [5, 6], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None These people are great sitting ducks for trashy institutions like Capella that are really all about misuse of government loan funding .####[([8, 10], [7, 8], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]

None Capella is a junk degree sold to a disenfranchised group who are looking for a Ph D in all the wrong places .####[([0, 3], [4], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None PhD's from Capella are the equivalent of a medical degree from a Wal-Mart pharmacy .####[]

None She does not seem to be able to work with students who have disabilitys .####[]
None I have had great reveiws up until now and may not graduate because one observer has thrown a wrench in things .####[]
None It is scary to think that you can work hard for four years only to have one person ruin it for you .####[]
None I would reccomend anyone taking Elementary Education to think twice about taking it at a satelite campus or at least request an observer who is competent if they are uncomfortable with the person observing them .####[]
None However , The teachers are outstanding and the instruction and assessment is fair.Saint Leo truly cares about its students but will not admit or send another observer if you request one to get a second opinion .####[([3, 5], [5, 7], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None It is not worth the expense to go into elementary education if you can lose it all at the last minute .####[]

None ( Thank goodness I only need 15 months of school to receive my bachelor's degree ) .####[]
None I pocketed around $6600 from my financial aid and student loans per semester at Fresno State and it was great but I had to ATTEND school everyday and it was getting to be impossible with my children .####[]

None Did I mention your hard earned degree isn't worth the paper it's written on ?####[]
None Heard that DIRECTLY from an employer that said they wouldn't hire a UOP graduate if they were the last individual on the face of the earth .####[]
None Wonder why ?####[]
None When the DOE contacts the school for information regarding a student and the school does not respond that should send up red flares immediately .####[]

None Online education is not for everyone , if you do not have self discipline or the ability to write well , this is not the forum for you .####[]
None If you want to be a doctor , lawyer or computer programmer this is probably not the college for you either .####[]
None As for the curriculum , it is for working professionals not kids that know enough to fill a thimble .####[]

None Any when I asked them what I should do in the mean time...and the adviser said to get a job .####[]
None Ok , 1 .####[]
None I have a a job and 2 . THATS WHY IM GOING TO SCHOOL .####[]
None I wish I could express how screwed over I felt when finding all of this out .####[]
None And on top of that , I plan on getting my PhD in Biomedical Engineering , and apparently DeVry isn't considered a valid school for that degree , so if you want to go somewhere else to receive a higher degree , you have to start from scratch .####[]
None It's overpriced for what it is .####[([1], [1, 3], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]

None first , it took almost a year for me to start getting payments from the VA because the VA rep at the school kept " losing " my paperwork .####[]
None i eventually had to send it myself by certified mail .####[]
None and , because of the 5-week class schedule ( 6 for masters ) , the payments are not regular .####[]
None at traditional schools , you get a set amount each month you are enrolled .####[]
None at Phoenix , you do not receive your VA payments until after the end of each class , and it is pro-rated for the month , so you only get a partial payment , based on the time of the month you complete the class .####[]
None overall , the classes provide good information .####[([3, 4], [6], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None as a program designed for working adults , there is sometimes a lot of homework , and the instructors are hit-and-miss as far as quality of instruction .####[([18, 20], [20, 22], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None my biggest issue is with the school's relationship with the VA . this has been major problem since I started , almost 2 years ago .####[]
None Veterans should stay away from Phoenix , as they will not receive the full benefit of the GI Bill .####[([5, 8], [3, 5], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None while the VA says that it will pay up to $39k of my tuition , it will only actually pay a set amount each month , for as long as i am enrolled .####[]
None that amount is less than the cost of my classes , so in the end i will end up paying close to $3,000 out of pocket for my education .####[]
None the University already has an arrangement with the VA for verifying student enrollment ; they should also make it possible for students to get the full benefit of their GI Bill , and not be left paying thousands of dollars out of pocket .####[([15], [15, 17], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]

None However , he is not the only person who has expressed concerns about their degrees , and I can guarantee you that , at least in my case , I have not posted anywhere else on the subject.Regarding the argument you make about teaching , it has several problems .####[([14, 16], [11, 12], [4], 'Neutral', 'Weak')]
None First , just because 80% of these people are teaching , does not mean that the capella degree got them those jobs , or that the degree will be considered by those institutions when they have completed it .####[]
None I know someone who was hired as professionally qualified with a master's degree .####[]
None They are enrolled in an online program for a Ph.D . but their institution has already indicated that they will not recognize the degree , nor allow the person to use the title Dr . when they have it.Second , you do not specify the type of employment ( adjunct , full-time , tenure track ect . ) .####[]

None If that's your goal , then you're fine .####[]
None I will reiterate however , that most colleges of business will not consider a Ph.D . from a non-AACSB college of business .####[]

None As of now , I have had only one instructor who - although I liked him as a person - I felt maybe could have done a bit more as far as joining in the class .####[]
None The course material I feel is sufficient and I've yet to have any real problem with people in my team .####[([1, 4], [6, 8], [0], 'Neutral', 'Strong')]
None That's not to say that there haven't been the occassional bad apple - there has been - but for those of you you have been in a team you know that when you set up you team charter you also lay down the team rules .####[]
None With this school you get out of it what you put into it - like anything you do in life .####[([2, 4], [5, 14], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None I am a working adult and am newly married so this school works for me , and when the wife decides when she wants to start having children I will be thankfull for this school .####[([11, 12], [13, 14], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None I've never - let me repeat - NEVER had a problem with the faculty .####[]
None Everytime I've needed something from them they've been right on top of it .####[([6, 8], [9, 12], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None Again - I have no regrets .####[]
None If you go in with a foul attitude your experience will reflect that .####[]
None Great school .####[([1, 3], [1], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None Knowledgeable teachers and good programs .####[([1, 3], [0, 1], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]

None I hired an employee who was " earning " a Masters degree from the University of Phoenix .####[]
None This person was incapable of writing a coherent sentence or of displaying basic analytical skills .####[]
None Yet I would hear this person gleefully talking about the latest A she earned in her Phoenix course work .####[]
None If this is the academic rigor required by this for-profit school then they are producing a product from an apparent diploma mill .####[([10, 12], [20, 23], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None I will never again hire someone who claims to have a degree from the University of Phoenix .####[]
None My experience at UOP has been quite rewarding both on a personal and professional level .####[([4, 5], [7], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None Here is my two cents with regard to the MBA flexnet program .####[]
None I graduated in September of 2007 at the Western Washington campus .####[]
None The majority of the instructors in the graduate business program were very good to excellent , however at any institution ( top ivy league institutions included ) there are bound to be a few bad apples and UOP is no exception .####[([4, 6], [12, 13], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None Even in a city like Seattle , recently ranked as the #1 educated city in America http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/Departments/elearning/?article=educatedcities variation in the circles of academia is not uncommon .####[]
None Therefore , you must realize this fact exists at any institution , so grow up and get over it .####[]
None You must be stubbornly determined to stay the course and finish the program .####[]
None Yes , the learning team environment has pros and cons , but what learning model is perfect ?####[([3, 5], [8, 11], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None I was fortunate to have stayed with two members of my learning team for most of the program and one relocated for an outstanding career opportunity after about 85% of the program was complete .####[]
None I believe what set our team apart from others is newcomers had to prove themselves , otherwise they were provided an exit strategy upon course completion .####[]
None Sounds cruel ?####[]
None Well , thats part of life and perhaps the individual learned something in the rejection process that is reflected in the working world .####[]
None Otherwise , you are crippling them in the educational process and the future challenge of life .####[]
None Additionally , our team kept each other accountable through constant contact and meetings .####[]
None If you expect the professor to manage your learning team , they dont have the time and your team is responsible to assume ownership .####[]
None Brainstorm a process and use it or you will be disappointed and discouraged .####[]
None One negative issue I have with the school is the incessant online marketing campaign .####[]
None In some ways potential students can view this negatively and may give the appearance of lowering academic rigor and quality , which is not the case in the MBA program .####[([8], [8, 10], [4, 6], 'Neutral', 'Weak')]
None Hence , I lowered my rating to four stars .####[]
None In terms of promotional opportunities , I interviewed for an internal position with my company and I received a substantial increase in salary ( double digit ) and responsibility .####[]
None After graduation , I still keep in touch with many colleagues and the student alumni association at www.phoenixalumni.com####[]
None Networking is perhaps the single most powerful tool one can use to uncover career possibilities .####[]
None There will always be negative people , especially with the current paradigm shift occurring in academia .####[]
None This pattern is typical of new issues that arise with the advent of technology and education is no different .####[]
None Consider the evolution of other issues ( i.e . workplace , political , economic ) that have changed over the past generation .####[]
None Initially change is resisted , evolves over a period of time and eventually become a standard policy or procedure .####[]
None Furthermore , at minimum verify the online program is regionally accredited .####[]
None I wish you the best of luck in your future education .####[]

None The Professors make me feel like I am family or a good friend .####[]
None I attended Monmouth University ( Very Good School ) for a degree in EE many years ago before they dumped the program for Software Engineering ( EE was not making money for them ) .####[]
None I can confess that the difference is like Night and Day .####[]
None At Devry I get Lots of Labs to reinforce the theory ; at Monmouth University I get lots of theory but few labs ( I need Labs , I am not good with theory only ; I need to see the pictures , YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN ) .####[]
None At Devry University the Professors go out of there way to make you understand the material giving you extra time to absorbed the concepts ( Naturally you have to show interest and willingness to learn ) .####[]
None Here is an Example :####[]
None At Monmouth University####[]
None I had 2 semesters in Digital Electronics and One semester in Microcontrollers w/ Assembler language ( Solid ) with 1 senior project for a Microcontroller Car )####[]

None I asked a Devry ECT advisor in Pomona CA why Devry was called a University .####[]
None He gave me a dictionary and asked me to look it up .####[]
None So I looked up 'University' .####[]
None I understand the definition but he didn't answer my question .####[]
None Why is Devry called a university ?####[]
None Who grants the accreditation and which accreditation are the most important ?####[]
None I wanted a side by side comparison but the advisor just shut me out .####[]
None If you're young , you have the time to go to a four year college .####[]
None Do that instead .####[]
None It's cheaper and classes won't be cancelled because no one enrolled but you .####[]
None I wish I've known this ; I came from a foreign country and thought this was a good 'shortcut' .####[]
None By shortcut I'm mean learning only the stuff you need to know for your major .####[]
None Devry , Keller , Phoenix or some Tech schools keep calling me but I pay no attention to them .####[]
None It's a good thing I supplemented my Devry degree with classes from a neighboring community college , mainly math classes .####[]
None By the way , if you pay for a service , you are a customer .####[]
None Because of that you should demand your money's worth .####[]
None Don't let them treat you like a student ; you're a customer before you're a student .####[]
None At the beginning of my enrollment , I signed papers relieving me of my ability to manage my account .####[]
None I was thinking , cool they can manage it for me .####[]
None But that isn't the truth .####[]
None They will charge you for stuff that no one really knows about .####[]
None I asked several employees why they were charging tech fee ?####[]
None They couldn't answer my question .####[]

None More problems :####[]
None They couldn't get my name right , my personal info was never updated , I still get forwarded mail from my previous addresses which are a month late .####[]
None The community college I go to isn't much better in the way of equipment but I believe the USA is really suffering from lack of money for the school system .####[]
None Education should never be for sale in the first place .####[]
None Whatever you do , don't start at Devry .####[]

None On EVERY " learning team " I have been in , me and another person were always the ones doing all the work ( familiar story ? ) .####[]
None Everyone else came up with the usual UOP excuses : " I'm sorry , I had personal issues " ; " I'm sorry , I had a family emergency " ; " I'm sorry , I had computer trouble " .####[]
None Basically , these are issues that you can't argue with but you know are total BS...towards the end I just completed assignments myself and submitted the team papers with only my work showing because I refused to have my grade compromised due to incompetence .####[]
None As far as learning , like other people said you really have to WANT to learn the material .####[]
None If you bust your ass and do all the reading , answer all the sample problems in the book and are motivated , you will learn plenty .####[]
None If you sit on your lazy ass and BS your responses , you will learn absolutely nothing but you will still probably get an A...or maybe a B+ if you were really horrible .####[]
None Now that I am at the end of my Bachelor's program , I feel so unfulfilled that I am going into a ( real ) school for my Master's .####[([9, 13], [15], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None Even though I have a career and most likely won't need either the Bachelor's or Master's , I need to complete a real graduate school just for piece of mind .####[]

None I did learn about my major but only because I wanted to...the rest of the tool bags did nothing yet got the same grade as me .####[]
None Maybe I'm the sucker afterall . . .####[]
None What a waste of money !####[]
None The field reps ( some-most ) are rude and don't want to do their jobs .####[([2, 4], [8, 9], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None Even for DE you still have to go stand in line for an hour or so to register for your classes .####[]
None Isn't this DE , DISTANCE education ?####[]
None I've taken 4 proctored exams . 1 of them was never sent and 1 was missing an entire page when received by the instructor .####[]
None Often you have no idea what your final grade is for a course because of these pitfalls until well into the next semester .####[]
None That can be rather depressing .####[([1, 2], [3, 4], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None Don't even bother emailing the administration .####[([5, 7], [1, 3], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None They won't respond .####[]
None UMUC brags how they cut breaks financially for military .####[([1], [2, 3], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None Their tuition is as high if not higher than that of a resident state universities .####[]
None Go to a real DE University , I am as soon as I find one that I like .####[]
None UMUC should be ashamed of themselves for even calling themselves a university .####[([1], [1, 5], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]

None Those that say this is a Diploma mill need to take a better look .####[([4, 6], [6, 9], [1, 2], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None It is accredited by the same body that accredits the University of Illinois and other Big 10 schools .####[]
None That means that a diploma from Capella is worth the same as a diploma from the University of Illinois .####[]
None It is by no means a diploma mill .####[([2], [4, 6], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None The course work is challenging and I do not feel like I am being short changed .####[([1, 4], [4, 6], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]

None Although the university requires participation 4 out of 7 , the facilitators require content that show intellegent analysis .####[]
None The individual projects , often based on simulations , are pertinent to the topic but require you to really think about handling situations .####[([2, 4], [15, 21], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average'), ([2, 4], [10, 12], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]

None You must be very disciplined .####[]
None As for financial aid , I have no experience with it .####[]

None In many cases I felt more like a revenue generator than a student .####[]
None It's all about the money .####[]
None In many cases emails and phone calls are ignored .####[]
None I had to escalate to the dean several times to get any satisfaction .####[]

None It was a 25-minute drive , if you didn't hit traffic .####[]
None Finding parking was a challenge and I was tired all of the time .####[]
None Having a career and attending school full time is overwhelming .####[]
None I did not take the easy way out .####[]

None Regarding financial aid , enrollment , and academic counselors , there have been no issues .####[]
None Financial aid is something that you pretty much take care of yourself through the FAFSA website .####[]
None The financial aid counselors are just there for guidance .####[]

None Just because one employee misrepresents a company , doesn't mean you should bad mouth it .####[]

None They have used one of the books that was used by a professor of mine from a SUNY school that would only teach with graduate level books for undergraduate courses .####[]
None I believe this university is of good quality and would refer others to it .####[([7, 9], [7], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None The only pet peeves I have is that citations should be taking more seriously , as some students have either not cited properly , but did have citations and group work is hard to manage .####[([8, 9], [3, 5], [0], 'Negative', 'Weak'), ([30, 32], [33, 36], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None Other than that there are no other complaints I have .####[]
None The only thing that I can assume is that some professors are leanient on citations is do to the fact that some students have been out of college for over 10 years or more , so they are not up to par with what should be done for citations .####[([10, 12], [10], [0], 'Negative', 'Weak')]
None DeVry is not accredited in Texas .####[]
None It is granted permission by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board , but it still is not regionally accredited like all state and private universities in Texas .####[]
None Just because the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board gives DeVry the authority to label itself a University , does not make Devry credible as an institution of higher learning .####[]
None Quoting DeVry website : " DeVry University* is accredited by The Higher Learning Commission and is a member of the North Central Association "####[]
None Quoting The Higher Learning Commission Website : The Higher Learning Commission accredits , and thereby grants membership in the Commission and in the North Central Association , to degree-granting educational institutions in the North Central region : Arkansas , Arizona , Colorado , Iowa , Illinois , Indiana , Kansas , Michigan , Minnesota , Missouri , North Dakota , Nebraska , Ohio , Oklahoma , New Mexico , South Dakota , Wisconsin , West Virginia , and Wyoming####[]
None So before attending DeVry check the accreditation in your state thoroughly , to make sure that the degrees validity will not be compromised in the real world .####[]
None I suspect this site was created for some good reasons .####[]
None In the computer age , we are in a fight for REAL DEGREE DIPLOMA vs FAKE DEGREE DIPLOMA .####[]
None CAMPUS vs VIRTUAL SUCCESS .####[]
None There is a bitter fight with scare tactics and propaganda to veer individuals away from certain schools of online learning .####[]
None I think it is great that people have an area to vent , but the creator of this site and all of us should be careful not to conclude misleading information to individuals about AIU or any other school , unless we have concrete evidence at hand .####[]
None I can understand someone being upset and reporting or telling others , but some people have had a great experience at AIU , UOP , and other institutions that have bad comments on the site .####[([19, 21], [19], [14, 16], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None Each experience is different and my heart goes out to any misfortunes .####[]
None I have a TRADITIONAL Bachelor of Science Degree and I'm strongly considering achieving my Master of Science online .####[]
None To be factual , all higher learning advisors and administration usually have degrees in business , because all higher learning institutions are " for profit " and are ultimately " a business " just like any other business in the world .####[]
None They are offering an education and marketable services , Right ?####[]
None When someone finds a free of tuition school , call me .####[]
None I could really save on my Masters .####[]
None There isn't a school diminished from flaw that cannot be placed on probation for the slightest unmet conditions .####[]
None If a school meets the necessities of the US Department , then they are accredited and I doubt any employer would turn away a U S Department accredited degree .####[]
None If so , they are idiots , because most employees don't have a traditionl or online degree for that matter .####[]
None When it's all said and done our children in the future and mostly all schools(even highschool , and elementary ) will be virtual in some regards in just a short time .####[]
None Then what will empoyers , students , and other angered " for profit " schools in competition benefit from trying to put any degree or school in the " inadequate school pages of the worldwide web " Accelerated means just that , faster and more intense .####[]
None I believe most any basic degree ( not including any field of Doctorates , they need efficient practicum , etc . ) can be earned in a year or two as long as you earn each degree in a respectable order and earn it through a high standard curriculum and educator .####[]
None Most universities prolong education , not just for the assurance or sake of a student's adequate education , but for financial gain also .####[]
None Anyone that has been through college can probably relate to what I'm saying .####[]
None When I contacted AIU , the first thing they asked was did I have at least an Associates to apply , becasue at first they thought I wanted a Bachelors .####[]
None Although I have a higher degree , it was already initialized if I didn't have an Associates I couldn't apply for a Bachelors .####[]
None Now , I don't know about you , but most colleges online or traditional institutions don't do this .####[]
None This could be a good or bad thing .####[]
None Some will see it as holding a higher stander of entry into an educational institution and some will see it as bank robbery .####[]
None Beware though , sometimes this is used in order to make more money from innocent first-time students that really desire a Bachelors Degree , but not yet have the Associate level completed .####[]
None This could be an attempted tactic used in marketing to ultimately make more money overall from an individual student if they decide to continue their Bachelors after gaining their Associates through the same institution , because of strong encouragement through faculty and administration .####[]
None Last but not least , here is a link to check out some REAL TRUTHS about US Department higher learning institutions .####[]
None If you ever have a question about any school , investigate it here http://ope.ed.gov/accreditation/ .####[]
None Keep in mind that institutions aren't obligated to have a listing with the U S Department of Education , but it is wise to choose any school that is .####[]
None This will help you to achieve more from future employers and educational opportunities .####[]
None I apologize for any typographical errors .####[]
None My time was very limited to make this post .####[]
None I think this site has its purpose .####[]
None It does encourage people to investigate universities before applying .####[]
None Everyone keep sharing thoughts and using your own abilities and minds to select the right institution regarding your own individual preferences and expectations .####[]
None Okay , I have to chime in here , b/c I see a lot of negativity out there :- ) I just received my Master's degree and this was the most difficult set of courses I've _ever_ gone through ( bar none ) .####[([33, 36], [31], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None I found the required discussion/participation in class very rewarding , as NO ONE can sit in the back of the class in this type of venue .####[([4, 6], [8], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None It is imperative ( to your grade ) that you participate in discussions ; there is a lot of knowledge and experience imparted in these discussions ; much more so than I would have received in a traditional brick and mortar classroom setting .####[]
None Why ?####[]
None For one ( that I'd noticed when we all got to Commencement ) is that most people were older than the typical Master's students at a BandM at a University campus . A lot####[]

None I was suppose to have the application fee waived .####[]
None Well , the online counslor pissed me off so bad , I refused to attend .####[([3, 5], [11, 12], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None Then we deducted the application fee from my tutition fee and did not refund the entire amount to me .####[]
None So I spoke to an on-campus representive , who doesn't answer my e-mails/and a financial counselor who calls me at home when I am at work .####[]
None Now , I can finally see that I am enrolled in a class , but of course they want $1345 now .####[]
None There is a resource charge of $70.00 and I have to ask what that is for .####[]
None They were suppose to give me a credit for the $110.00 and they have not .####[]
None Of course .####[]
None I think that they are only after everyone's hard earned money .####[([4, 5], [7, 12], [0], 'Negative', 'Average'), ([4, 5], [2, 3], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None They don't care .####[([1], [2, 3], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None My goodness , why would I need to take a general class when I already have a AA degree .####[]
None They offer same classes for their BS degree as what I took for my AA and transferable units .####[]
None I am thinking that I need to look around more .####[]
None I am currently working on a doctorate degree through UOP online , and it really fits my life .####[([10], [14, 16], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None Secondly , the classes are not watered down at all .####[([3, 5], [6], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None If anything , the classes can be extremely demanding for a working professional as myself .####[]
None I also get the latest information concerning the field of education .####[]
None In addition , I am able to learn about issues in education from various points of views through classroom discussions that occur online .####[]
None My experience was similar to surprised's from June of 2007 .####[]
None I'm a somewhat embittered former doctoral level Capella learner who earned a 3.76 GPA through my masters with another institution , a 3.933 GPA all through the doctoral coursework with Capella , and who had no problem passing the comps at Capella the first time around .####[([7, 8], [2, 3], [0], 'Negative', 'Weak')]
None What was my experience during the dissertation process ?####[]
None A lack of oversight from my mentor resulting in many mis-steps and dead ends , months of delays in the development of my proposal because of the same , and a continuously-frustrating lack of " connect " between the guidelines that Capella's School of Human Services provided at the time , and what my committee was even aware of-in the end I withdrew out of frustration .####[([41, 42], [2, 5], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None I will likely always regret withdrawing , and I know I'll regret not earning my doctorate .####[]
None I honestly , though , saw no end to the frustration .####[]
None After it all , and as an educator in a public school district ( K-12 ) , I have a very hard time understanding how anyone could be willing to accept anything less than excellence from an institution that charges $50,000+ for an educational program .####[]
None If anyone has had a similar experience , please send me an e-mail at searchinglearner@juno.com , I'd be interested in comparing notes .####[]
None You're lying my friend got an " A " on the knowledge check test and missed none .####[]
None She showed me her knowledge check test and I saw it with my own eyes .####[]
None So , you should want to consider telling the truth next time ?####[]
None Just because you can't pass the knowledge check tests doesn't give you the right to lie about people not making above a D+ . Pay attention to your classes and actually read the e-books .####[]
None I'm a current student of UOP .####[]
None I think that if some one ask me " Are you here for a diploma ? "####[]
None my answer is " YES " .####[]
None I'm finishing my BSIT , and after talking to dozen of friends and other professionals that are in the IT industry , the diploma is all you need to get the opportunity to sit with an HR and have an interview .####[]
None 99% of all professionals told me that 99% of the times , experience is key to get a job in IT . Besides , every IT company that hires fresh out of collage IT graduates as soon as the hiring happens , the person gets send to training on what the job for the person will be .####[]
None Regarding learning , you learn if you do your work .####[]
None I can sit around and make excuses all the time and have other people do the work , but I opt to do the reading and to participate to learn basic skills .####[]
None What collage teach you technical skills from top to buttom ?####[]
None If you're in one , you should be call a technician , not a college graduate .####[]
None Collage will teach the basics and the roots people need to understand to then take more specific training ( by the company ) on the actual work to be performed .####[]
None I don't think UOP should be deminish because of some people that think they're the smartest people on earth , nor for people that didn't appreciate the value of going to school and earn a bachelor's degree from the conform of the home with flexible schedule .####[([4], [2], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None For those that don't like UOP , think the following : The next time you sit on a nice office making 50K or more because of the UOP degree you have stock on the wall , and 10% of what you do is what UOP gave you in education and 90% comes from the employer trainning , but your employer wouldn't hire you without that diploma you have on the wall , think again what your opinion of UOP will be .####[([7], [4, 5], [2, 3], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None Please don't go here .####[]
None They were or still is on probation .####[]
None They are also too expensive and not very challenging .####[([1, 2], [4], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None You only have to earn 3 credits in Math-Business Math .####[]
None You want to be proud in the college you attend and AIU is not one .####[]
None Save your money .####[]
None This is an honest assessment of the UoP : I graduated from the University of Phoenix in 2005 with a Bachelor of Science in IT .####[]
None I did the first 2 years of my Bachelor's Degree at a community college , but after deciding that I didn't have the cash to complete my course of study in this manner ( traveling to and from school and working full time ) , I decided to go with an online college...the University of Phoenix .####[]
None To be completely honest , I was extremely disappointed with the University from many aspects .####[([11, 13], [7, 8], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None The instructors give students a passing grade for a minimum amount of work , and are overly lenient with their grading .####[([1, 3], [16, 17], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None I learned so much more at the the community colleges that I attended ; the standards were higher , and the professors were so much more dedicated to being teachers - not just paid staff .####[]
None I would not recommend the University of Phoenix to anyone that is seriously interested in learning .####[([5, 9], [3], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None Take it from someone that has already obtained a degree from this institution...it's not worth the money for the degree , or the piece of paper that it's printed on .####[([12, 14], [14], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None If you want an easy degree with little work , low standard , and sub-standard assessments,(i.e . an easy pass ! ) , then go with The University of Phoenix .####[([27, 31], [11, 13], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None If you want to actually learn something , stick with a state school or the community college .####[]
None At least the instructors at these institutions aren't getting paid on commission , or by the number of students that pass their subjects .####[]
None It is the absolute truth that school is what you make of it .####[]
None I have been attending UOP for over a year now .####[]
None First , I started in OH and then had to switch to IL when I moved to Chicago from Cincinnati .####[]
None The students at the Dayton , OH campus left little to be desired and had no ambition and some because it was too challenging for them .####[([21, 22], [23, 25], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None Most of the students would drop to where my class sizes ranged from 3-5 persons .####[]
None The faculty in OH was great and so was the administration .####[([1, 3], [6, 7], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None They were all very fair and very invloved with the student body and I am someone who got mostly B's and C's at first .####[([1, 2], [4, 5], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None I am very intelligent when it comes to Mythology and even after I worked my ass off with 2 and 3 papers a week , I still only earned a C . : ) That was still my favorite class because of the challenge and I learned much more than I already had known...learning only one new thing is worth your money alone .####[([40], [38, 39], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None The Chicago/Schaumburg classes are great !####[([2, 4], [5, 6], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None I have wonderful classmates that are actively involved , great instructors...for instance , one of my instructors had worked for NASA and one had worked for CIA several years before !####[([3, 5], [2, 3], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None I have little good to say about the administration here in IL as opposed to OH , but that is the trade-off .####[([8, 10], [2, 4], [0], 'Positive', 'Weak')]
None I do my work and work hard to get the grades that I do .####[]
None The Learning Team concept can be challenging , but very rewarding...it teaches you the concept of reality...the life of hard knocks .####[([1, 3], [6, 8], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None If you can't motivate your teams , put extra effort to make up for the slackers in order to get your grade that you want , then how do you expect to get the career you want and be successful .####[]
None It really sharpens your problem-solving skills , educates one on the powers of motivation and still makes you work hard as an individual .####[]
None Those of you that think that a traditional University is better , than you are ridiculous ! ! First of all , I come from a very successful family .####[]
None They all have stories and truths about students who fake their way through school even at the Universities that they attended which include , YALE , CORNELL and University of Illinois .####[]
None It is because they have that accessibility to the student body .####[]
None Next , I prefer to pay for my own education as an adult when I'm focussed and working at a real job .####[]
None That means that I don't suck mommy and daddy dry to pay for the education while I cheat and sit on my ass , gossipping at the local Starbucks or putting on 50 lbs because I hit all the Sorrority/Fraternity parties that I can in 4 years ! !####[]
None Third , the world is changing over to modern technology...who do you think is going to have one up on the technology...it's part of the curriculum and with UOP having the largest student body , who do you think is eventually going to be looking over your resume's ? ? ?####[]
None I can honestly tell anyone out there that I have been to a traditional University and MOST of the student body and faculty are superficial .####[]
None Do you have professors that can first hand teach you about real life ? ?####[]
None Do you have professors that have done anything other than teach class...for instance , that have worked for NASA ?####[]
None Probably not .####[]
None Don't be so judgemental and stereoptypical because that is what will stand in your way of a real career before a degree from your school of choice will .####[]
None The funny thing is that the people that work at this University in administration...that can't do their job right for anything(that means as easy as making a phone call ) went to traditional Universities ! ! ! !####[([13, 14], [15, 16], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None I just completed a masters in education at Jones International University .####[]
None It was extremely challenging and demanding .####[([1, 2], [2, 3], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong'), ([1, 2], [2, 3], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None But I learned more than I have in any other educational setting .####[]
None My husband is a graduate of CTU with a Master's in Software Engineering .####[]
None He is also now a virtual adjunct professor for the school .####[]
None He is a very dedicated instructor and does his best to make sure his students understand the material .####[([5, 7], [4], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None He is also employed at a large company as the Enterprise IT Manager , meaning he is in charge of the entire company's IT needs .####[]
None This is a very challenging , demanding , and well paying position that he would not have gotten without his degree from CTU .####[]
None He worked hard to earn his degree while working full-time and helping me raise our 2 children .####[]
None He earned his Bachelor's degree from a very reputable liberal arts school with many accredidations and felt that CTU was equaly challenging with equal possetive and negative issues on the business side .####[([19, 20], [20, 21], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None I recently transferred my credits to CTU , no problem , to complete my degree .####[([4, 6], [9], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None I feel I have been treated very well and my classes are in deed challenging .####[([10, 12], [13, 14], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None This is no diploma mill .####[([1, 2], [3], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None This is a regionally accredited school with qualified instructors .####[([8, 10], [7, 8], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None In fact , because my husband is a professor , I was given nearly a full scholarship from CTU .####[]
None I will earn my degree and only end up paying a little over a thousand dollars .####[]
None That is not a typical gift from a school that only cares about the money .####[]
None I think all schools have their pro's and con's and all students have possetive and negative experiences with the school they attend .####[]
None I have had some challenging classes and some easy classes at every school I have attended , CTU is my 4th .####[]
None CTU has their share of possetives and negatives for sure , but I think it is unfair for people who clearly haven't done their research , to critisize an entire school based on a couple experiences with a few staff members .####[]
None Online education is in high demand and all schools are cashing in on it .####[]
None Stanford , Columbia , Cornell , Berkley ; these are only a few of the Ivy League schools now offering online programs .####[]
None There are many reputable accredited schools offering this option .####[]
None US News lists hundreds of big name schools accredited by the same organization as CTU , using the same virtual course software , charging the same or higher fees , with some lousey professors and some great ones , and that also have their share of pro's and con's wether it be in the education or business arena's .####[]
None All you have submitted are accusations that have not went forth to determine CTU as an unfit educational institution .####[([14, 15], [17], [2, 3], 'Neutral', 'Weak')]
None Walmart and Home Depot have accusations applied to them almost on a daily basis .####[]
None We can't stop venture capitalist or investment firms from purchasing what they think is an investment .####[]
None This is why we have checks and balances including government oversight .####[]
None Anyone can accuse someone for something . . . .####[]
None I attended a traditional college for my BS and tried to continue that with my MS ( few years separation there ) , but with work , wife and kids it became difficult in terms of time driving , taking notes in class , etc .####[]
None Its now been 5 years since I graduated from UoP and I have to say it has help me get promoted .####[]
None Most companies and government job want you to have have a MS degree for management jobs , but as long as they are accredited they hold value .####[]
None My 3 years getting the degree was not easy spending on avg 20 hours per week on discussions , homework , papers and group assignments .####[]
None ( Traditional classes you dont get this type of experience ) .####[]
None You do learn since it forces you to read ( and write alot ) the textbooks that come with each class and ability to ask questions to your instructor and/or fellow students when you dont understand .####[]
None Iam speaking from experience here and UoP has helped me in my career and you do learn new things .####[]
None Its better than not doing nothing if you continue to go to traditional colleges but never seem to finish because of your business schedule .####[]
None I have been a student for almost a year at UOP and I have had no problems with it .####[]
None It did concern me reading all the bad reviews , but I never experienced anything that those reviews were stating .####[]
None The classes can get challenging at times , but I've always been able to get a hold of the instructor either online or by phone .####[]
None They've been a great help .####[([0, 2], [4, 5], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None I would recommend UOP to a friend .####[([4, 6], [2, 4], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None One of the worst things about Capella is that it doesn't integrate technology into its courses .####[([6, 8], [4], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None There are no Power Point slides , no telecourses , no video feeds or rental tapes , etc .####[]
None In fact , all you can expect to do at Capella is read and write ( in the traditional , visually unappealing , and very boring way ) .####[([10, 12], [21, 23], [0], 'Negative', 'Average'), ([10, 12], [25], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None There is actually very little teaching going on , except for what you are teaching yourself through your own efforts ( reading and writing ) .####[]
None You can expect to learn more from your fellow classmates than any instructor teaching at Capella .####[([15, 17], [6, 12], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None At least that has been my experience and I have taken 6 classes with 6 different instructors .####[]
None Whatever you choose to write about in your discussion posts is fine .####[]
None There are no corrections in your thought process or interpretations because there is no teaching going on .####[]
None They make you use APA but it doesn't matter .####[]
None Why ?####[]
None Because if you get your grammar and punctuation wrong , no one bothers to correct it .####[]
None Again , there is no teaching going on .####[]
None I just don't understand why quality instruction can't be provided by a university with no actual campus and high tuition rates .####[]
None Can't somebody please summarize and highlight the important points in my text through , say for example , a slide presentation ?####[]
None How nice the staff and administration are is secondary to getting a proper and useful education .####[([5, 7], [8, 10], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None Don't you think ?####[]
None I came from microbiology background and I wanted a management position in life sciences so I attended university of phoenix online .####[]
None For me it was a great experience because I learned many new business concepts .####[([3, 4], [6, 7], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None I think university of phoenix online provides excellent educational opportunity for professionals who work full-time and want to persue with a graduate program in MBA .####[([2, 6], [7, 8], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None Overall , I was satisfied with UOP Online .####[]
None My GPA was 3.73 .####[]
None Mr . Arslan####[]
None I have been a UMUC student for 2.5 years now .####[]
None I started my education at a main stream college and then kind of lost my way .####[]
None I have had some great educational experiences here at UMUC .####[([6, 8], [4], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None My main complaint with UMUC is the disorganization among their administration .####[([10, 12], [7, 8], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None I live in MD ! I should be able to get a hold of someone to give me a straight answer on what classes I need to take in order to graduate .####[]
None I have been told several times now several different things concerning what I need in order to graduate .####[]
None I was supposed to be done May of this year , and then I found out I needed 12 more credits .####[]
None I then went to work trying to complete these credits over the Summer .####[]
None I thought I would be done on August 18th of this year .####[]
None I found out this morning that I need yet another class .####[]
None I am supposed to start Graduate school this Fall ( not at UMUC ) .####[]
None If I am not done with my classes by August then I have to defer for a year !####[]
None I have already paid a nonrefundable acceptance fee to this graduate school .####[]
None Moreover , I just want to be done with my undergraduate degree .####[]
None I will have enough ( 120 ) credits by the end of the Summer .####[]
None How can these people just lie to adults about their futures ? ? ?####[]
None PLEASE , do not enroll in the University of Phoenix Online .####[([7, 10], [3, 6], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]

None I have taken 8 classes toward my B.S . in Business Management .####[]
None I will tell you firsthand this school DOES not care about your education...only the money you give them .####[([6, 8], [9, 10], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]

None I have NEVER been so confused by financial aid .####[]
None I have had 3 counselors since I started and lots of problems .####[]
None The only time I hear from them is when I owe them money .####[]
None Good luck trying to get someone to call you back any other time .####[]
None What they are doing should be illegal .####[([2, 3], [4, 8], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None PLEASE !####[]
None I know you want to finish school and this appears to be a convenient way to do it , but you will only have more headaches , I promise !####[]
None I have been researching this school ever since I started having problems and there are just way too many students out their with the same claims .####[]
None PLEASE !####[]
None Do not waste your time and money !####[]

None Man for everyone satisfied you will find 10 POed about something .####[]
None I attend CTU and frankly I prefer it over brick and mortar BS .####[]
None In a B and M you have the class clowns , the ones that are there for social status and then those who ride the backs of others .####[]
None I have been there for some time and yes there is good and bad .####[]
None Where isn't there after all ?####[]
None I admit that when we get people that constantly say I'm confused I believe they belong in a B and M .####[]
None Another thing and I am sorry to say this .####[]
None I honestly wonder why some of the people are there even .####[]
None I mean seriously it is Unversity level grammar and professional based workmanship , not HS .####[]
None The thing about CTU that people do not understand is that their course are degree specfic .####[]
None Not a meld with emphassis on a subject .####[]
None It is true it is hard and challenging .####[([5], [6, 7], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average'), ([5], [7, 9], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None The instructors are there to help , but they will not give answers .####[]
None It is our job to figure and show we grasp the meaning of what we are supposed to be learning .####[]
None Can you do that on a paper with a multiple choice quiz ?####[]
None It is high impact and self paced learning , with that do not fall behind .####[([2], [3, 5], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None We utilize research tactics that we are left to explore and believe it or not the teachers learn from us .####[]
None They are true professionals in the field that they are teaching , not a tenderd professional student .####[]
None I did look into other schools and I choose CTU for my reasons , not because of someone elses thoughts .####[]
None If that was the case I would not buy dog food at Wal Mart .####[]
None An education is something that is earned from various walks of life .####[]
None Where you recieve that education is your choice .####[]
None I am not championing CTU , it is only one of many options .####[]
None If you can not work on your and commit do not attend an online campus .####[]
None If you can make it through the first year , you will see that the lazy ones drop like flies .####[]
None My CET graduating class was three people .####[]
None And I believe the EE's had seven , and the biomeds had five that made it out okay .####[]
None It's not easy at all , but college isn't supposed to be easy .####[]
None Even if you make it out with under a 3.0 GPA , you will have learned a lot , ( although there aren't many who graduate with under a 3.0...the professors are quite adamant about making sure you learn what is required ) .####[]
None I've attended two state universities and a community college and none have compared to the excellence at Devry .####[([18, 19], [15, 17], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None Sure the academic department is a pain in the ass , as well as the financial department .####[]
None But where is it any easier ?####[]
None Arizona State University wouldn't allow my loans to transfer from Northern Arizona University because I couldn't obtain a letter from the IRS that proved I had paid taxes for the previous three years .####[]
None As a result , I had to come up with the cash for that semester .####[]
None I don't see how that's any better or worse than Devry taking a little time to receive federal loan funds .####[]
None At least Devry lets you attend school while you figure out how to pay for it .####[]
None And yes , like any other secondary educational institution , they are also trying to make money .####[]
None You need it to pay for the computers , the school activities , and for the professors who have given up their jobs in industry to teach students what they've learned .####[]
None The professors are not only your instructors .####[]
None They are your foots in the door , your references , your mentors , and for some of us life-long friends .####[]
None I promise you , if you do well and work your ass off , it pays .####[]
None Because if you can prove to your professor you're good at what you do , they will find you a job , ( 98% of them do care ) .####[]
None After all , they have probably taught you since your first semester , ( at least that was the case for the engineering programs at the Phoenix campus ) .####[]
None My data structures professor once said that teaching is the best job anyone could ever obtain because you have the opportunity to make a life-long positive impact on someone .####[]
None But if you're going to bitch about your own grade , then that is your problem and not the professor's .####[]
None You are the only person who can learn - it isn't the professor's responsibility to spoon feed you what you missed when you slept in every Friday .####[]
None And read a book , for christ's sake .####[]
None And as for " vulgar reading material"...get over it .####[]
None We're all adults ; I would hope that you could find the underlying message in a book rather than harp on the choice of words and/or adult situations .####[]
None One final thought for the tlsail individual : Don't you think it's a little ridiculous to not hire someone based on where they got their degree ?####[]
None Isn't it making an assumption about someone's intelligence based on your own bad experience ?####[]
None Remember , Devry is an accredited university , and as such they are judged by the same standards as all other accredited institutions .####[]
None Instructors are serious about helping with questions .####[([0, 2], [2, 3], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None There is a lot of dialogue among the students and among the instructors and at least two live sessions per week with instructors .####[]
None Great follow up on finding employment opportunities .####[([1, 4], [1], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None Ouch ! Some pretty harsh comments posted here , not all unwarranted .####[]
None As a current student UMUC-Europe , I can confirm that not all comments posted here are loaded , but I must say , many are .####[([4, 7], [20, 23], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None Does anyone really buy that the Director is posting “student's names , social security account numbers , and addresses on the World Wide Web” .####[]
None If you do , try checking that claim .####[]
None I doubt you’ll find much to back it up ; I tried and failed .####[]
None But , as I mentioned , many claims posted here have sustenance .####[]
None Sometimes , the books assigned to a course are sub par ( and I stress SOMTIMES ) , grades for some courses come in slowly ( really annoying ) , and “in-class” courses get canceled often ( in Europe ) .####[([18, 20], [26, 27], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong'), ([18, 20], [24, 26], [0], 'Negative', 'Average'), ([4], [0, 2], [0], 'Negative', 'Weak')]
None But some of these issues are very easily explained ( even justified ) if one takes the time to think about , as one post asked , “what is UMUC doing in Europe” ?####[]
None Well , they are there serving the military community with scattered all about Europe and the Middle East .####[]
None You see , UMUC has a contract with the Department of Defense to educate the military community stationed overseas .####[]
None Someone has to provide for the education of military members and their families while stationed overseas .####[]
None It is the Department of Defense that dictates what kind of programs can be offered to their community overseas .####[]
None In fact , it is the DOD that pretty much runs the show .####[]
None Now , To conduct an in-class course ( Face-to-face ) , there has to be enough people registered in that class to carry it on , and if there is not , well , the class gets canceled and field representatives try to encourage students to take distance learning courses ( that never get canceled ) in lieu .####[]
None With bases closing , and more and more of our soldiers being deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan etc . . ( and their wives and children going back to the States ) , enrollment ( in-class ) is falling and classes are being canceled .####[]
None I also here a lot of complaints directed at the faculty and staff at UMUC-ED .####[]
None Just a short insider bit of info I got from a friend that works there : UMUC-Europe employees get paid roughly half of what their counterparts in the states get paid AND , given that they are much less resourced , do twice the work .####[([36, 37], [38, 39], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None I would assume that is a factor in their oftentimes less-than-sunny dispositions .####[]
None To put in my two cents of the University , I’ll say this : I have done my research , and for what it is ( an institution catering to the military community , ..and think about what that means ) , UMUC does a great job providing education for military members stationed overseas .####[([43, 44], [46, 47], [0], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([8, 10], [5, 7], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None Yes , things could be done better , but I guarantee that it is the BEST University with a home-base overseas if only for it’s broad range of programs ( in comparison ) , it’s quality of education , and it’s flexibility .####[([14], [16], [0], 'Neutral', 'Strong')]
None I graduated with a B.S . from a great University in the States , so I like to think I know what good instruction is .####[]
None UMUC-ED may not live up to my previous institutions academic standards , but you know what , I think to think that you get what you give .####[([0, 2], [3, 4], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None Just a few cents from a UMUC-ED student .####[([6, 7], [3, 5], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None I took classes for a year at UMUC Online .####[]
None The teachers were awesome .####[([1, 3], [3, 5], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None The best i have experienced in online classes .####[([7, 9], [2, 3], [0], 'Neutral', 'Strong')]
None The financial aid office was always messing things up though , and the amount of work involved in some of the classes was well above what i have experienced elsewhere , even in the regular classroom setting .####[]
None I have am half way through my second course with the UOP and I must say that it is well worth the extra money .####[([12, 13], [20, 22], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]

None I really feel the professors are great and readily available if you contact them .####[]
None Many of you complaining about DeVry and some of you even think it is a scam .####[([6, 7], [16, 17], [8, 11], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None That is not true at all .####[([1, 2], [5, 7], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None As a matter of fact , it is not where you go it is how you apply yourself and make the most out of your learning experience .####[]
None The same class ( i.e computer class ) being teach at Ivy League schools are being offered at DeVry .####[]
None Many of you think that you can get a high paying job with a good GPA like 3.5 - 4.0 or going to a better known school ?####[]
None That is not true at all because I know peoples that went to top school in the nation like North Western and U OF C and they were struggling to find a job after graduation and in many cases they settled for a job that is not in their field .####[]
None In a technical field , they required experience in addition to your degree .####[]
None A degree is just a piece of paper like a passport to get you in the door but after that you must prove yourself after that .####[]
None I interned for IT companies while going to DeVry and work as much as I can to get alot of experience in programming , networking and business throughout the entire 3 years .####[]
None 2 months before I graduated , I was offered job to Kanbay International , AllStates and IBM and their starting salary was around 65k ( this is over 8 years ago ) .####[]
None While some of the students who were graduated with distinction ( 3.9-4.0 GPA ) can't find a job and have to settle for a less pay job starting at 50K .####[]
None So , if any of you think that you can get a good job in technical field(s ) with your degree by itself then you're wrong .####[]
None Companies want experience workers and they will hire someone without a college degree even if you can prove that you had real working experience .####[]
None Don't get too hang up about where you go to school .####[]
None Apply yourself , be prepared for the real world by getting a job in the field that you're studying for and shoot for a B or better average in school and you will be fine .####[]
None At the end of the day , anyone considering Capella ( or any other school , for that matter ) will have to make his or her own choice .####[]

None Every complaint or issue I have had has been quickly resolved with a simple phone call or email .####[([1, 5], [9, 12], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None But don't just take my word for it ; consider as many well-respected , objective sources of opinions as you can gets your hands on , and THEN form your own opinion .####[]
None Examples include regional accrediting bodies such as North Central ( http://www.ncahigherlearningcommission.org/ ) , the Sloan Consortium ( http://www.sloan-c.org/ ) ,####[]
None or Noel-Levitz ( http://www.noellevitz.com/ ) .####[]
None I don't know why this site seems to attract people who have sour grapes with respect to Capella , and I don't know what motivates them to pretend they are a better judge of academic excellence than those who make their living assessing the academic quality of insitutes of higher learning .####[([17, 19], [13, 15], [9, 11], 'Negative', 'Weak')]
None My advice is that you consider that they are entitled to their opinion , but that you do your homework in order to make an informed choice .####[]
None i just applied for devry university online and i am concerned with the entrance exam !####[([13, 16], [10, 12], [0], 'Negative', 'Weak')]

None I just finished my AA in Business/General Studies through UOP ( Axia ) .####[]
None I have to admit , I have learned twice as much in this school , with this set up and schedule , than in any other college .####[([13, 15], [4, 6], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None I really think that the topic of UOP is 50-50 ; it goes both ways and there will never be a wrong or a right answer .####[([8, 9], [1, 2], [0], 'Neutral', 'Strong')]
None It is an opinion and I find it hard to believe that people who attended one class can bad mouth the school ( Some don't even make it through one class , they drop out 2 weeks into it ) .####[([12, 14], [9, 12], [0], 'Negative', 'Average'), ([21, 23], [19, 21], [12, 14], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None A bad situation can happen to anyone , and perhaps this resulted in a cost of a lot of money for that person , but I think that , that goes for everything .####[]
None If one were to have a bad experience , especially for the first time trying something new , it would appear as something that doesn't work for you .####[]
None To go and bad mouth the school based upon this situation is just wrong .####[([6, 7], [13], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None I loved all my experiences with this school and I am proud to say that I will be transferring over to the UOP bachelors in Business Management .####[([7, 9], [2, 3], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]

None I am proud to tell you most of them drive expensive cars , what does that say ?####[([9], [3, 4], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None I have to tell you , if you are debating the school because of what someone else says , you should just give up all together ( would you jump off the cliff with them too ? ) It is expensive , but they work with you and they have always been great ( I got my financial aid with no problems at all ) .####[([40], [40, 42], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None I never would have never been able to finish school had it not been for this school .####[]
None I thank God for the creation of something so great for my education .####[([7, 9], [9], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None It really is a Blessing ! !####[([1], [1, 4], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None There appears to be an individual trashing Capella under a variety of names .####[([7, 8], [6, 7], [5, 6], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None I believe he was thrown out of Capella because of disrespecting other students .####[]
None The school did the right thing and asked him to leave .####[]
None He appears to have sour grapes .####[]
None You can go to www.degreeinfo.com/forums and ask about him and you will be told that he is bad news .####[]
None I am a Ph.D . grad in the school of Psychology at Capella .####[]
None I have no complaints .####[]
None I found the staff and the professors bending over backwards to help you be successful .####[]
None You are treated with respect .####[]
None I have buds of mine that got their Ph.D.'s traditionally and they have horror stories concerning doctoral committee members that from hell and total narcissists who loved to show superiority ( and stupidity ) via abuse .####[]

None I was not aware of so many horrible opinions of the university .####[]
None Which have me questionging if i had made a mistake .####[]
None Yes it is extrememly expensive , almost three times more than what i was paying per credit hour , so much that the military tuition cannot cover all of it .####[]
None I have noticed when contacting my councelor it is hard to get a hold of them , and when i leave voice mails i never receive phone calls back .####[]
None One issue that extremely disturbed me was just recently i received an email stating there was an error in my paper work and that i could not be matriculated ( i find this out now two weeks into my class ) .####[]
None I contacted the finance office the person on the other end was short , and pointless with responses to my answers ( i am beginning to wonder ) .####[([3, 6], [13, 14], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None I have gathered the impression of the people in class as being fools .####[([7, 9], [13, 14], [0], 'Neutral', 'Weak')]
None It seems most of them are on there to get by and pay for their degree .####[([5, 6], [3, 4], [0], 'Neutral', 'Strong')]

None For now i have had a somewhat decent experience , concerning at one point but decent for the moment .####[]

None UOP will accept anybody , regardless of their reading/ writing ability etc . Whereas , a traditional or even a community college always has some type of placement exams to see where you stand .####[([1, 2], [2, 5], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]

None DeVry is a sad sad place .####[]
None The education is worthless .####[([1, 3], [3, 5], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None Don't do it .####[]
None You are all too smart for falling in this trap .####[]
None Stay far a way .####[]
None I do not know the quality of the education at this school .####[]
None I am sure it is fine as it is self paced and you get what you are willing to put in to it , I suspect .####[]
None However , the people that do the admissions need lots of training .####[([7, 9], [10, 11], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None They are very nice people until you deviate from what they want you to do .####[([1, 2], [3, 4], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None Then they become abusive .####[([2], [3, 5], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None I literally was screamed at and hung up on .####[]
None Screamed at isn't like spoken to in an angry voice .####[]
None Screamed at like at the top of your lungs , like a little child having a tantrum .####[]
None After complaining to someone named Matt Veril who said , he was sorry if I was upset but wasn't " there " when it happened so couldn't say anything about it . . uh hello ?####[]
None I haven't ever met a supervisor that would take the side of a badly behaving employee .####[([15, 17], [14, 15], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None Sounds to me like it is a tactic they use .####[]
None Because not one but two different departments tried to strong arm me .####[]
None I think the school probably is a good one , but they need to come up with a different way to admit people .####[([3, 4], [4, 7], [0], 'Positive', 'Weak')]
None The way it is now , they wont keep many clients .####[]

None I will be starting online classes through the University of Phoenix in just a week and I have to admit that I am very nervous after evrything that I have read , so I decided to do some research of my own .####[]
None My biggest concern was the way that employers would view my degree .####[]
None So I asked a career counsler at a former school that I attended .####[]
None ( a traditional school by the way ) and was told that many online degrees are considered useless by employers but certain schools like The University of Phoenix and a few others are just as respected as any other degree .####[([25, 29], [34, 37], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None In fact they are becoming so popular that employers that dont consider aplicants with online degrees are having trouble finding employees .####[([3, 4], [6, 8], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None I was also warned that getting an online degree did involve a lot more work and a lot more self discipline .####[]
None Its not going to be easy .####[]
None I emailed a staffing agency as well .####[]
None The told me that most companies have no issues with an online degree from an accredited school .####[]
None Infact there are a few companies that prefer them because of the self disipline that is required to graduate .####[]
None They also told me that there are some companies that are uncomfortable with hiring an aplicant with this type of degree .####[]
None Usualy because of a bad experience with one employee who ruined it for the evryone else , or the company is run by an older generation that does not understand or accept change .####[]
None They wished me the best of luck and told me that they would love for me to aply once I recieved my degree .####[]
None Ok , now that I've stated the facts , I'll give you my opinion .####[]
None If an emplyer would not consider an aplicant because they dont understand the hard work , dedication , and self-disipline that you put into earning your degree , then they are not a very forward thinking company and are probably not the type of company you would want to work for .####[]
None There are still some things that concern me , like the financial aid issues that I have read about and the problems with the team assinments .####[]
None But I have spoken to my financial aid counsler and she has been very helpful so far .####[([11, 12], [14], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None I guess I will just have to keep my fingers crossed and hope that i get a good team that is as dedicated as I am .####[]
None And If I dont then hopeful I will learn how to deal with a crappy team in case it ever comes up in the workplace .####[]

None I checked on my next 3 classes and there was absolutely nothing relevant to accounting besides the importance and history .####[]
None The textbooks I read through reminded me of a history or english class .####[]
None Anybody who takes the time to do the work will get an A . Grades should be determined by attendance , effort , and skills learned .####[]
None Not attendance and effort .####[]
None Learning to write essays on the importance of accounting is ridiculous , and I believe that a person who hopes to gain knowledge of accounting and be able to have a career in the accounting field should steer clear of UOP .####[([0, 1], [14, 40], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None UOP disgraces academics by collecting tuition from students and giving useless information for working adults which will only teach the adults how to write reports .####[([1], [1, 2], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]

None Where did your research in the university go wrong ?####[]
None If it was so bad , than you should have dropped out the moment you felt it was going wrong !####[]
None At least than you could have went to your university of choice where I am sure your money will be well accepted there as it will be anywhere .####[]
None Problem is you did not have the grades or time to attend the University of your choice like Stanford , Harvard , Yale , ETC .####[]
None So , you had to go a university where the prestige may not be where it is as compared to the schools mentioned but to me seem to provide a pretty good education .####[([7, 8], [13, 14], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None Get over it ! ! Put your bad experience on yourself .####[]
None Yes , there are those who help us create a bad experience but it is what we do when confronted with a hurdle that can change the situation .####[]
None Even leaving after all that is said and done is an option .####[]
None For someone to complain that UofP is a diploma mill who is now able to attend a top 50 university seems to me that UofP helped him get there .####[([6, 8], [3, 5], [1, 3], 'Negative', 'Average'), ([6, 8], [8, 11], [1, 3], 'Negative', 'Average')]

None Also seems he or she did not have the grades before to attend that university prior to him being accepted by UofP .####[]
None More than likely this whiner found someone he or she thought was to stupid to go school , had a degree from UofP and decided to downgrade their degree based on this person .####[([28, 29], [26, 27], [4, 5], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None Any way smart person , there are plenty of unknown small universities out there you can go to .####[]
None It is your responsibility to find out which programs are accredited and which ones are not .####[]
None Accreditation too has it's standards on who they accredit like do they have a big plushy office on the campus , are they allowed to have free meals , do they have box seats at the big game when they come to town ?####[]
None If you did not see that one coming then you truly need to go back to school .####[]
None To lifeisgoodoutthere : I've just reported you to the administrative area of RateItAll...AGAIN !####[]

None other readers and potential reviewers out there , please be patient while RateItAll works this problem out .####[]
None This person has just had numerous reviews yanked off of this site just last week because they refuse to be civil and respectful of anothers viewpoint and experiences with Capella .####[]
None This person also has numerous aliases so watch out for their reviews .####[]
None The site will find them all and take away their right to post if they keep it up .####[]
None The university does a fine job of providing distance graduate education .####[([10, 12], [5, 7], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None Some argue it to be a diploma mill without understanding the facts of the school .####[([4], [6, 8], [1], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None Its fully accreditited by the Higher Learning Commission , the same regional accreditation body that certifies the Air Force Academy , the University of Chicago , Indiana University , Kent State , Purdue and a host of others .####[]
None It suffered some growing pains as any organization with its growth rate would , and perhaps it didn't manage its quality with as much perfection as one would have hoped ; but its nothing like the University of Phoenix in terms of being oversized or targeting a lowest common denominator .####[([33], [33, 35], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None Those who can't write well or conduct proper research fail to finish the program .####[]
None They can't pass their comps , and they can't complete their dissertations .####[]
None Anyone who wants evidence of the quality of a Capella graduate can either stand by for the stories of their success to come , or read the published research completed by these students available at http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/search/advanced/school and enter Capella .####[]
None Its a fine school , with over 70% of the faculty terminally degreed , and it gives the chance for bright , hard working , non-traditional students to prove themselves from anywhere in the world .####[([26, 28], [23, 25], [0], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([26, 28], [20, 22], [0], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([2], [3], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]

None Those with sour grapes couldnt cut it , have an ax to grind , and are devoting their time to smearing the school .####[([22, 24], [20, 22], [1, 4], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None Naturally , if you want to devote your time and talent to a traditional graduate degree program then go for it .####[]
None Its a noble undertaking .####[]
None Its a proven honor .####[]
None If youre a working professional or at a point in your life where you cant sacrifice the time to return to a brick and mortar environment for several years but still think you have what it takes to contribute to academia and earn your credentials , right now Capella is probably the best choice you have .####[]
None On-line education is here to stay .####[]

None I finally got a good advisor , but by that time my f.a . expired and I had to move on with around 5 course left to graduate .####[([5, 7], [5], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]

None DeVry - Serious about Success , Not SEX .####[]
None So if I had a second chance in life , I would go to a community college , learn computer like the others , have alot more prettier girls in my book of love , still be skilled and certified in what I want , get a Tech job on the side and in the real world , and save that $30,000 I owe .####[]
None Who needs to know so much computers ?####[]
None Not even the POPE .####[]
None So , to put it short , if you go to DeVry , and focus on learning and not F!!cking , you'll have a great career , but also end up paying loans for 10 years that could equal a brand new car note .####[]
None Or you can enjoy life and see sunlight , have a wife and a girlfreind and some baby mama drama . . AMEN . .####[]
None I have a question for you guys .####[]
None I am considering going to Devry to further my education in either ECT , CET , or CIS while still in active duty in the US Navy .####[]
None I'm an Aviation Electronics Technician , and I currently have 7 years experience working with electronic / mission systems , radar , micro-electronics , test benches , aircraft electronics and systems , etc , etc , - my question is...I have read that DeVry isn't so well suited for a " first degree " ( ie , someone right out of high school ) .####[]
None By the time I get out of the Navy , I'll have 10 years work experience in the electronics / computer field .####[]
None I realize I still need an education to get a decent job , and was thinking that a degree from DeVry would fit with my work experience more than a standard Electrical Engineering , or Computer Science degree from a traditional college .####[]
None Keep in mind that money is not an issue for me , however time is a constraint .####[]
None I'm a father / husband and need to keep supporting my family and go to school .####[]
None This is the other reason devry sounds appealing .####[([6], [6, 9], [0], 'Positive', 'Weak')]
None What do you guys think ?####[]
None I would appreciate everyones opinion .####[]
None Is it better to get a traditional degree in EE / CS that doesn't really fit well with my previous work experience , or go to DeVry and get a degree in ECT , CET ( or maybe CIS ) that fits relatively better in regards to my work experience ?####[]
None Thanks in Advance : )####[]
None I graduated from Devry , and my two cents about it .####[]
None I work in the field as a software engineer ; graduated in 2004 and have been employed since .####[]
None Likes : - On hands training ( a lot of lab work ) - Some very knowledgeable experts were my professors ( this matters because you learn best from those who have real world knowledge , and not just from an individual with a masters or phd and no real world experience ; and yes more of my professors had obtained their phds ) - very good guidance and counseling on what courses will be required and what courses mesh well with certain other courses taken during the semester Dislikes : - expensive as hell , at least for a tech school - the university has more of a business approach ; rather , than a campus to serve the students approach - too many units in one semester ( if you are on the accelerated program ) - you don't get the same atmosphere as other universities ie . parties , sports teams , or hot chicks ( lets face it hot girls don't want to become engineers ) From my experience during my attendance at DeVry , I noticed only two types of students ; those who want a piece of paper that states they are engineers , and those who actually strive at becoming engineers because they know their future livelihood will depend on it .####[([178, 180], [94, 97], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong'), ([126, 127], [124, 125], [0], 'Negative', 'Average'), ([20, 22], [16], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None Therefore , if you are the sooner rather than the latter then go to a JC and save yourself a lot of money .####[]
None Also , you can tell which students just wanted a hand me down diploma ; because they would always drop out during their later semesters and the lucky ones who managed cheated their way through .####[]
None p.s . I didn't cheat : ) my 3.2 gpa is proof of that , not too good and not too bad####[]
None I got my MS in CIS from UOP , and since then I have been promoted , and I am able to teach part time at a local college in my area .####[]
None Overall , my income , which was pretty good before , has risen over 20% as a DIRECT result of my degree from UOP .####[]
None I graduated from the University of Virginia ( UVA ) for my undergraduate degree , and the work at UOP was at least as hard as the work at UVA , which is one of the very top public schools in the nation .####[([20, 21], [22, 26], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None I am a good writer , and UOP improved my writing .####[]
None I am a good manager , and UOP improved my management skills .####[]
None I am a good technician , and UOP improved my understanding of the interaction of business and technical aspects of our field .####[]
None UOP helped me be more disciplined in my work ethic , and UOP helped me refine my ability to communicate .####[]
None When we finished our degree program , I missed the daily debates , discussion and feedback .####[]
None The traditional model of school - lecture , reading , etc , with possibly a discussion section once per week - is not nearly as much fun as daily online interaction with a group of highly motivated , dynamic classmates .####[]
None UOP is NOT perfect - we had a couple professors that were not great ( most of our professors were very good , with relevant , current field experience ) , and my financial aid counselors DID change constantly .####[([1, 2], [3], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None Some of our team projects were hindered by people not doing their share .####[]
None The experience would be better if they had a bit more standards as to whom they let in - we had one teammate who did not write English well , which meant we had to do or re-do most of his work on our team projects ( welcome to real life ! ) .####[]
None However , no one lied to me , pressured me , or refused to return my calls .####[]
None Actually , I almost never HAD to call anyone .####[]
None Everything was taken care of when needed .####[]
None Not a problem .####[]
None Most of my classmates stayed together through the entire program , and they were great .####[([13, 14], [15, 16], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None The best part of the program was learning from my classmates and professors through online discussion .####[([5, 7], [2, 4], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None Very rich experiences from which to draw .####[([2, 4], [1, 2], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None Some people talk about accreditation : UOP is accredited the same as traditional schools - by the regional accrediting agency nationally recognized by the Dept of Education ( North Central Association , in this case ) .####[]
None There is no higher accreditation you can get , in general .####[]
None I cannot speak about the MBA program , and what accreditation is needed for that specifically .####[]
None If the UOP MBA is not going to be recognized as much as you would like , then don't get one there .####[]
None You can find an MBA program on any street corner .####[]
None I can easily recommend UOP to a lot of people .####[]
None Not perfect , but was great for me .####[]
None I am a proud full time Mother of an 11 year old son ; a wife ; and during the day a hard working IT Program Manager for a major automotive company .####[]
None The University of Phoenix is a blast and with only three classes left I am sad that the program is almost over .####[([1, 6], [7, 8], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None I complete my final class on May 1st , 2006 .####[]
None I have really enjoyed being able to attend an accelerated program .####[([10, 12], [2, 3], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None I have never had the time to get board with any given topic .####[]
None While the program is challenging it has been a wonderful learning experience .####[([2, 4], [9, 10], [0], 'Neutral', 'Strong')]
None I plan to move onto a Masters program upon completing the program here .####[]
None After working in the IT field since 1984 I am happy to say that the topic of Information Technology is never a boring one .####[]
None I thank the college for their wonderful program that emphasized team work ; individual study ; and even included global collaboration with people from all backgrounds .####[([7, 9], [6, 7], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None I would like to thank my professors as well for a wonderful job !####[([6, 8], [11, 13], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None I also owe thanks to my mentor for believing in me--pressing me to move the bar further to better myself .####[]
None What started out as something for the work environment has become a personally enriching experience .####[]
None I never imagined that I would strive to maintain a GPA so that I may graduate with a degree that shows the seal of honors .####[]
None That has been my goal for quite sometime .####[]
None After a few classes , it was no longer about doing this to move a head on the job .####[]
None It is about seeing the world through new eyes based on the world known as education .####[]
None From Socrates to Plato , Critical Thinking to Java , Geography of World Commerce to eCommerce--we have learned to see things in a new light .####[]
None We have grown and this turned in to an enriching experience that none of us will ever forget .####[([5], [9, 10], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None I am truly blessed for family , friends , fellow students , and to have had the privilege of learning....Many take education for granted when there are people in the world who cannot even get their basic needs met .####[]
None You see before school here at UoP I thought global about work ; however , never about the global people--there is a difference .####[([8], [22, 24], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None A huge vast world to see and learn about--we have only scratched the surface here !####[]
None I am more tuned in to the world and technology , I can proudly say .####[]
None I also care more about my neighbors around the world in a new way .####[]
None Yes , Getting Better , I found that also .####[]
None This is the biggest reason I decided not to go to this school .####[([12, 14], [8, 9], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None When you want to advance your degree in Psychology , the internship and your placements are just as important as the schools curriculum ( your Master's education ) .####[]
None The reason why Capella falls short is because they ARE an online school .####[([3, 4], [5, 7], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None Their geographic location(centrality ) leaves you to find your own mentors/internship which can be very challenging for the average student .####[]
None Most of the local schools have first dibs on these internship positions .####[]
None If your going to get an advanced degree in Psychology then you should go to a college that is local rather than online .####[]
None Think about it !####[]
None Applied psych has a relational component to it that you don't get that with most online schools .####[]
None The closest school that I have checked out that had a great online program for LMHC was down in Florida and this is because you are mentored online in real time .####[]
None This is the way to do it but still you have to find your own internship .####[]
None There is also a website the link is : http://www.capellafacts.org/capella_university_reviews.html####[]
None And to give an answer back to lifeisgoodoutthere which has since been erased , I find it hard to believe that someone would go through all the work to put together a site like this and not have had a very bad experience .####[]
None Its possible though not probable .####[]
None So I am going to look further into it and come back on this site and let everyone know what I've found out .####[]
None The BBB is a bad place for you to cite because most students wouldn't dream of going there to submit a complaint .####[]
None Thats what these sites are for .####[]
None Furthermore , if Capella is suing this person and he is lying then he gets what he deserves BUT if he is telling the truth , you can't sue someone for telling the truth or even telling their perspective unless they are malicious and thats hard to prove ! .####[]
None The best defense against liable is the truth .####[]
None The Supreme Court continues to uphold free speech rights .####[]
None There was a case on Angies list where a contractor was not getting work because raters were bad mouthing him so he took the owner of Angies list to court .####[]
None They ruled in her favor .####[]
None Besides , this guy did do bad work , he was good at selling himself but bad when it came to deliver .####[]
None This is no different for Capella or any other institution of higher education .####[]
None Why should you be rewarded when you deliver a bad product ?####[([3, 4], [10], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None No one out there should be afraid to tell the truth or let themselves be intimidated not to .####[]
None If you are practicing bad business tactics then shape up because your going to lose business because of it , no matter how much people like you try to stop it .####[]
None I am considering the doc program at Capella .####[]
None I have been accepted into Brick and Mortar but I am at a stage where I want to do some traveling and have a family .####[]
None An online program will allow me some flexibility personally and professionally .####[]
None I am , however , curious about the quality of professors teaching in psychology program .####[]
None Can someone with some experience in the General psych program at Capella talk about their experience and poss .####[]
None provide some insight .####[]
None UOP provides you all the tools to obtain your degree .####[([1], [4, 5], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None Yes , there are some people in the classes that do not belong there .####[([5, 7], [12], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None Yes , there are some instructors that appear unqualified to teach at a college-level .####[([5, 7], [8, 10], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None The school is not perfect .####[([1, 3], [4], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None Who knew ?####[]
None Personally , I have been relatively pleased with my experience at UOP .####[([0, 1], [0, 3], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average'), ([0, 1], [5, 6], [0], 'Positive', 'Weak')]
None I have found it to be more difficult than attending traditional classes .####[([5], [7], [0], 'Neutral', 'Strong')]
None They really load you down with work to justify giving you credit hours .####[([1], [1, 3], [0], 'Neutral', 'Strong')]
None Also , learning is easier for me in a physical classroom environment .####[]
None I like the face-to-face interaction with the class and instructor .####[([8, 9], [2, 3], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None However , I have made the experience work for me .####[]
None The people that have degraded the degree have their reasons I suppose .####[]
None Prior to attending the college , I made phone calls to businesses to ask for opinions of online degrees .####[]
None The fact that I will have an online degree does not disqualify me from an interview .####[]
None My work experience , how I interview , and my desire to succeed is what hiring managers care about .####[]
None In todays world , those are the things that are important .####[]
None Weaknesses in one of those areas can easily be overlooked because of the strengths in the other two .####[]
None The college is what you make of it .####[([1, 3], [4, 7], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None People can complain about their experiences if they want .####[]
None Other people can say UOP is the best school for anyone wanting a degree to attend .####[([5, 6], [8], [1, 3], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None The fact of the mater is this , you can achieve the same goal by taking other avenues .####[]
None Most companies will not be impressed by an UOP degree .####[([9], [4, 5], [1], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None Most companies will not be unimpressed by an UOP degree .####[([9], [4, 5], [1], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None The important thing is that you get an education .####[]
None How you use that education and succeed in life depends on you .####[]
None Went to capella for my masters in general psych and am attending now for my ph.d in the same program .####[]
None I plan to get my license ( in California ) to practice psychology .####[]
None I find the process challenging , the teachers good , and the courses expensive .####[([12, 13], [13, 15], [0], 'Negative', 'Average'), ([7, 9], [9, 10], [0], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([3, 4], [4, 6], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None My only gripe about the program is that it's not APA approved , a process that takes any school a few years to accomplish .####[]
None I know personally that Capella is rapidly attempting to gain APA accreditation .####[]
None The APA approval won't affect me ( most states do not require APA approval for licenser ) but I'd still rather have it for credibility .####[]
None Then again , I plan to open a private practice and have blue cross send me most of my paitients .####[]
None Most pt's don't care where you went to school , so long as it's accredited and you have your license .####[]
None I seem to have the personality that really matches online courses ( self-discipline , ability to manage time , basic computing skills , rather introverted ) .####[]
None If you're considering Capella ( or any online institution ) do yourself a favor and take an online course at your local community college .####[]
None If you seem to do well in that format , you'll know that online learning might be for you .####[]
None What I like about capella is that they are rapidly working to increase their prestige .####[]
None Mark my words , in a few years , haveing a masters will be as important as having a bachelors , and many people who don't want to commute or already have roots in a small town not close to a major U will opt for the online route .####[]
None At that point , Capella will become much , much more selective , which will then increase its prestige .####[]
None Might just make it the ivy of the online format .####[]
None Those interested in Capella might also want to check out Walden and Fielding .####[]
None Do not look to the U . of Pheonix or devry-- which have horrible reputations .####[]
None The site www.capellauniversitysucks.us/ is written by one disgruntled ex-student kicked out for making abusive comments during an online course .####[]
None Take the whole site with a massive grain of salt .####[]
None CONS : Many of you have had problems with the financial aid .####[]
None I too originally thought it was supposed to be some kind of grant ( the Pell grant I think it was ? ) until Apollo sent me a loan balance , which I never approved .####[]
None I quickly put an end to that crap and started my GI Bill .####[]
None I also had a problem with a biology teacher .####[]
None The problem was eventually corrected , but it pissed me off .####[]
None I also discovered it's difficult to find the proper channel to make a complaint against a teacher .####[([16, 18], [13, 14], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None And of course , there is the issue with the intelligence of your peers .####[]
None I have generally found that of a class of about 30 , only 4 or 5 people will have a firm grasp of the English language which hasn't been a problem for me so far .####[]
None Last but not least , I don't participate in forum discussion .####[]
None This hurts my grade slightly , but I read enough illiterate material at my job .####[]
None I fear that interacting with these people will bring me down .####[]
None PROS : As many on this site have stated , you can get an education from this place if YOU HOLD YOURSELF ACCOUNTABLE .####[]
None Yes , that means you actually have to read the course material and avoid BSing your way through the classes .####[([19, 21], [14], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None I personally save ALL my course material for later review .####[]
None After all , I paid for it .####[]
None Aside from the one biology teacher , I've had nothing but stout cooperation from most of my teachers .####[]
None They've always been willing to answer my questions ( or direct me to the proper forum ) , and I think they've given me fair grades .####[([25, 27], [25], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None I can't speak for other students' grades , as I have not seen them .####[]
None I generally find the work and reading to be moderately challenging , and enjoy doing most of it .####[([5, 6], [14], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None I will at the very least get my associates degree from UoP .####[]
None I can't vouch for the degree's clout in the real world , but I'll soon find out BEFORE pursuing my bachelors ( I'll get back to you on that ) .####[]
None Without the flexible schedule , there is no way in hell I would be getting my degree right now .####[]
None I have rent , insurance , and other expenses to pay which require a JOB .####[]
None Unfortunately , online education is the only way I can reach my goals .####[]
None To those of you enrolled , I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors .####[]
None For those of you who have had bad experiences , I hope you find a college that suits your needs .####[]
None Capella University suffers the same problems that all for-profit institutions have get the money !####[]
None Never mind if the University drops the ball ; it seems their policy is : never admit fault , because it is always the customers fault !####[]
None I tried Capella because I believed in online education , but given my experiences I would not recommend them .####[([19, 20], [17], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None In the time I have been there I have seen the names on the instructions list change often , and given what Capella pays the adjunct faculty I am surprised they put up with it .####[]
None It is sad when an institution is comprised of nearly 90% adjuncts .####[]
None Well we can see where Capellas priorities are I guess I would not mind paying a premium tuition rate if the institution was sponsoring research , but let us face it , Capella is a meat grinding machine get them in , spit them out !####[([32, 35], [36, 39], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None From an academic point of view , the faculty is great for the most part .####[([8, 10], [12, 16], [0], 'Positive', 'Weak')]
None However , from a business point of view , they are just like any other for-profit business masquerading as an education institution .####[([10, 11], [17, 19], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None Perhaps I am cynical , but I am uncomfortable what I see coming out of the institution .####[([16, 18], [8, 10], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None Just my two cents .####[]
None First of all , I only gave UOP a " 1 " because there was a " 0 " as an option .####[([9, 10], [7, 12], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None The experience at UOP has been nothing but a hassle .####[([4, 5], [6, 9], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None The staff is extremely unprofessional and unorganized .####[([2, 3], [3, 4], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong'), ([2, 3], [3, 4], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None My story is one that has probably happened to other people , and it involves financial aid , or lack there of .####[]
None I recently left the military and began using my G.I Bill for college .####[]
None When I enrolled , I opted to use my military money to pay for classes , but signed up for financial aid to defer the payment until my G.I . Bill took affect .####[]
None When my government money began to come in , I called the university to see what needed to be done .####[]
None I was told multiple times that because I was approved for aid through the university , the G.I . Bill money was mine to keep for personal use , and I was covered for eight classes .####[]
None After being told this several times , I thought that things were in order .####[]
None WRONG !####[]
None I was recently handed a bill of almost $6,000.00 .####[]
None The woman responsible for this was apparently discharged from the university , but they will not take the hit for this terrible mistake .####[]
None So , after hearing negative stories about some of their programs not being accredited , and actually reading on the internet that they do not offer accredited online courses , degrees , or programs , this has shown me that the University of Phoenix is nothing more than a criminal hoax .####[([41, 45], [45, 49], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None Everyone , do yourselves a favor and do not even entertain the thought of attending this apparent college .####[]
None I have to say the employees that supposively work for CTU that are rating the school as bad are full of it !####[([5, 7], [20, 23], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None I finished my first bachelors degree at the University of Colorado in Denver and personally found it time consuming and basically had to memorize , not apply any real knowledge .####[]
None I think I have used maybe one or two things from that degree .####[]
None I went back to get a second bachelors degree using CTU Online .####[]
None I have learned so much , and I apply it to my every day job with the US Government . . which by the way has actually recommended CTU as a school . . .####[([29, 31], [27, 29], [18, 21], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None I find the courses real life based information applicable to my job and recently just completed a course in which I applied so much of the material to a Managing for Performance course for management at work .####[]
None I think every businesses main goal is to make money .####[]
None I applied to UMass Online based off of their Lowell Campus and I also applied to a certificate program at George Mason online .####[]
None I would say the recruiters/finance and advising groups were all as pushy as the other and " brick and mortar " schools can't even compare to the curriculum that I received and will continue to receive at CTU Online !####[([4, 6], [12, 13], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None Keep up the great work and I hope that more schools start to release the benefits of this type of learning .####[]
None Words that best describe this school and WIU : ATROSCIOUS , SHOCKING , UPSETTING , UNSPEAKABLE , DISPICABLE , LIARS .####[([5, 7], [17, 19], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong'), ([5, 7], [11, 13], [0], 'Negative', 'Average'), ([5, 7], [15, 17], [0], 'Negative', 'Average'), ([5, 7], [13, 15], [0], 'Negative', 'Weak'), ([5, 7], [20, 21], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None This school is terrible when it comes to honesty and intergrity .####[([1, 3], [3, 5], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None The counselors do not communicate with you , and are appalling .####[([1, 3], [10, 12], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None They lie and note that they have communicated with you and never contacted you .####[]
None The instructors are very inconsistant , but it doesn't surprise me as the entire staff seems to be .####[([1, 3], [4], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None I am so dissapointed in this school , all I ever heard about was university of phoenix .####[([6, 8], [3, 5], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None I think at some point they were a number one online school , but somewhere they have lost what may have qualified them to be a number 1 school .####[]
None I also was duped with my financial aid and loans .####[]
None They don't care about anything but money .####[]
None The classes I had were worthless .####[([1, 3], [5, 7], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None I had better classes in the community college I attended , now I wish I had stayed .####[]
None The desire to have convience for me , is above all .####[]
None I am a student in Axia College of University of Phoenix , and about to enter my second block of classes .####[]
None I must say that I was very skeptical of this school .####[([10, 12], [7], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None However , when it all came down to what I could do , UOP was it .####[]
None I work full time and take care of a child .####[]
None So , anything with a set schedule was out for me .####[]
None I spent months researching different online schools ( I'm glad I did because I almost called ITT Tech ! ) .####[]
None I used student reviews to make my decision , as students are the most qualified to judge .####[]
None When browsing reviews , please take time to pay attention to the grammar and spelling of those writing them .####[]
None This can give you great incite into how qualified they were to enter college to begin with .####[]
None Those who say that the grading is too lenient are right , but you must consider other factors .####[]
None Depending on your major , getting an easy " A " in English isn't cheating you out of anything .####[]
None In other classes , such as those that deal with specific subjects not studied in K-12 , you must study to get a good grade .####[]
None There is no easy " A " when dealing with a subject that is not used in your everyday life .####[]
None You must also be self motivated and willing to work .####[]
None Your teachers will not call you and email you every five minutes when an assignment is due .####[]
None Since classes at Axia are not like traditional class rooms , you must be willing to learn on your own .####[]
None While there are class discussions , the only way to really get anything out of it is to spend time by yourself and learn .####[([17], [7, 10], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None One last thing I would like to add is that I have never read a review from an UOP graduate that had trouble finding a job because of where they got there degree .####[]
None University of Phoenix was a surprising disappointment .####[([0, 4], [5, 6], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None As a working professional , I have two bachelors , I oversee multi-million dollar estates , and will spend 60 or 70-hours a week at work if the job demands it .####[]
None I'm not a stranger to hard work .####[]
None I enrolled and was accepted into the MBA program and was greeted by many happy , helpful people that went the extra mile to get me enrolled in the university .####[([17, 19], [20, 24], [0], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([17, 19], [16, 17], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None Unfortunately , by my 4th class I was fully aware of a frustrating trend that my fellow classmates also commented on regularly .####[]
None The professors are more of a conversation mediator among the students than an actual professor .####[([1, 3], [4, 13], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None Assignments were passed down , but when asked to clarify the assignment because the syllabus had contradicting , poorly worded , information , my professors regularly responded...."refer to the syllabus"....but wait , the syllabus IS the question .####[([24, 25], [18, 21], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None It never seemed to matter .####[]
None The biggest issue I had with UOP is that the professors really didn't seem to care .####[([10, 11], [12, 14], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None Students would be expected to post generally around 2 postings a day for four days ( 8-postings minimum , 200-words min .####[]
None per posting...and that's just to get your 2-points for attendance/participation that week ) ; in addition there were the normal assignments to complete as well ( anywhere from 200-words to 3000+ words ) , these could be work 7 to 20-points .####[]
None For a master's level program , I had expected and welcomed a heavy workload .####[]
None By my 2nd and 3rd class in the program , a 10-17 page paper wasn't uncommon .####[]
None The disappointing part of the program was that the professors would generally only mark your postings with a green S ( substantiative=good ) or a red U ( unsubstantiative=poor ) .####[([5, 7], [1, 3], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None You could only see the professor's marks for your posting , not for anyone else's .####[]
None If someone posted something that was off target for the class , only that person and the professor would know .####[]
None It was very easy for people in the class to spend time reading and studying a topic that had no bearing on the intended class forum .####[]
None Discussions would regularly take side steps and stray away from the topics at hand .####[]
None If you organized everyone in the class by how much they contributed to the topic and to the conversations , the professors always seemed to be towards the bottom of the list .####[]
None I found that I spent most of my time learning from my fellow students .####[]
None The " real-life " experience of the professors were never passed along .####[([7, 9], [9, 10], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None A standard response from my professors would be that of a sentence fragment .####[]
None Assignments and Discussion Questions ( DQs ) seemed like they were copied and pasted from previous classes .####[]

None UMUC's quality of education plummeted faster than Enron stock .####[([0, 1], [4, 5], [0], 'Neutral', 'Weak')]

None Also , the only reason there getting rid of BMI is because they are not making enough money of it because there are not that many students in that major .####[]
None OH but they love GSP , they got a bunch of students in that major most of them dont even do there work they just play video games all day .####[]

None All the low ratings of UMUC F2F courses , online programs , and administration in Europe have got to be hurting business .####[([6, 7], [3], [0], 'Neutral', 'Weak')]

None I was told by a college advisor at my school , but I'm not to confident on his word .####[]

None I'm hoping I could recieve some help from some of you on making my decision .####[]
None It's a shame you don't have negative stars .####[]
None I took a single class from Devry years ago , which I paid for at the time .####[]
None Obviously Devry agreed that I'd paid , since they sent me my final grade , and later sent several transcripts out to other institutions .####[]
None Five years later , I discovered that Devry had turned my supposedly delinquent account over to some disreputable collections agency .####[([18, 21], [17], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]

None Of course we all know how disreputable collections companies are , and the kinds of people they routinely hire and use .####[]
None Devry turned my account over with my social security number as the account number , so I've had no choice but to put watches on my information with the credit bureaus and on my individual credit accounts .####[]

None I'll admit that before beginning my education at Capella , I did not think online learning would be that difficult ; in fact , I think I assumed it WOULD be easy .####[([14, 16], [13], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None I was wrong ; I assure you , online learning at Capella was the most difficult form of education I have undergone !####[]
None It is almost completely self-learning ; and to those of you who are " unlearned " in the art of self-learning , there is nothing passive or lazy about it .####[]
None By the end of each course , I would look back at the coursework I completed , and would be so amazed at the ground covered and the knowledge gained .####[]

None Most instructors are very involved and available ; and you interact more with peers than what might be required in traditional brick and mortar .####[([1, 3], [4], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None I will say , I often did miss the physical interactions that a brick and mortar education offers ; and you do have to be prepared for the " silence " ( which , by the way , was maddening to me at first ) .####[([29, 32], [39, 41], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None But you do adapt ; and I was actually quite thankful that I could attain such a thorough education in the comfort of my own home .####[]

None I would say about 4/5 teachers were competent professionals and hard-working teachers .####[([11, 13], [10, 11], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None That is pretty good for any school in my opinion .####[]
None The Cons : The weekly assignments require rigid discipline .####[([5, 6], [8], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None We all had day jobs in the MIS program , and coming home after 10+ hours to spend 1-2 hours writing discussion question answers was not what I would have preferred .####[]
None But that's the discipline you accept if you want an advanced degree while you're working .####[]
None One or two of my courses were just lousy ( Programming and Project Management--yet I got an A and a B+ respectively , so I'm not saying this out of misplaced resentment ) .####[]
None Overall : I think it's worth the money .####[]
None But as the wise man said : " Garbage in / garbage out . "####[]

None I am roughly 4 courses from finishing my 2 year program .####[]

None The execution has been less so .####[]
None The deliver technology is good and has gotten better since I started in the program , especially with some of the materials and research resources .####[([2, 4], [7, 9], [0], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([2, 4], [5, 6], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]

None I had student in my class who could not communicate and had little understanding of English .####[]
None Some students could not understand the material and had such poor spelling and grammar , that I could not believe they were graduate students .####[]
None They also did not work at the level of a graduate student 2 . Instructors .####[]
None Some instructors were quite poor , and do not supply lectures or proper feedback on work .####[([1, 3], [4, 5], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None 3 . High costs .####[]
None Twice , I have experienced tuition increases .####[]
None Although this happens at traditional universities as well , the program is relatively quite expensive compared to a traditional university , which requires physical facilities .####[]
None 4 . Poor quality overall .####[]
None Too easy to get an A . You can slide your way to an A with little effort .####[([4, 7], [1, 2], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None I purposely did not submit work , with the expectation that I would not get an A , only to be surprised .####[]
None Overall , I would not recommend the UoP for anyone at this time , unless the program and way it is managed changes .####[([8, 9], [5], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None The goals marketed to the public are correct ( flexible , adult education ) , but the corporate goals of the Apollo Group conflict with the goals of an educational institution .####[([19, 20], [23, 25], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None It is possible to get some knowledge from the program , but this requires the student to read all the materials .####[([9, 11], [2, 4], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None Otherwise , a student can obtain a high grade with little effort .####[]
None My Master's in Information Technology at UMUC stings as one of the great bad investments of my life .####[([7], [7, 9], [0], 'Negative', 'Average'), ([7], [14], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None The whole experience was so utterly fraudulent on so many levels .####[]
None But I was already invested in the third semester before I could no longer dismiss as flukes my astoundingly incompetent or apathetic professors .####[([22, 24], [21, 22], [0], 'Negative', 'Average'), ([22, 24], [18, 19], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None Egregious plagiarism was the name of the game : Professors regularly regurgitate curricula and lectures from prior semesters .####[]
None Students merely copy and paste discussion threads into their own submissions , knowing their instructors award grades based on automated metrics like word count .####[]
None Power Point is considered an acceptable format for term papers !####[]
None No thesis required for a Masters degree .####[]
None And the anonymity of online study , already a huge obstacle to an edifying experience , is I believe actively promoted by UMUC for the simple reason that its impossible to criticize when you cant organize .####[([23, 24], [18, 19], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None I recall one class in which our instructor logged in ( and this is not an exaggeration ) twice during the semester : once to greet everyone and once to collect our final exams .####[]
None Four or five of us managed to overcome the anonymity of our chat rooms to take action : a formal letter to the administration which went totally unanswered .####[]
None I guess what I find most depressing is the thought of people pursuing their undergraduate degrees at UMUC .####[([18, 19], [6], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None Having gone to a traditional University for my Bachelor's , I simply cannot imagine a graduate of UMUC's Web Tycho interface having experienced anything substantive .####[([23, 24], [24, 26], [15, 17], 'Neutral', 'Strong')]
None And it may sound elitist , but it just seems depressing to think of tens of thousands ( a href=http://www.umuc.edu/ip/umucfacts_02.html ) of people walking around , thinking they've learned anything more than how to manipulate a web interface .####[]
None That UMUC is accredited raises some serious questions about the state of academia and the trend towards distance education .####[([2, 3], [4, 8], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None And I do suspect that these problems are not unique to UMUC .####[([12, 13], [3, 5], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None High-bandwidth distance education , through which real bonds , expectations and communication can take place , might work some day .####[]
None But the current state of distance education is just too shallow , but promoted by an educational system too strapped for cash and a community of working adults , too strapped for time .####[]
None UMUC's WebTycho interface is at best a pretend classroom with a few clever javascripts and java applets to entertain you while you wait months for feedback on that paper you're now starting to feel embarrassed for having taken so seriously .####[([0, 1], [5, 7], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None You'll learn though , and by the end of your program , you'll find you needn't even bother buying the textbooks and you can get by with a couple manic hours of copying and pasting once or twice a semester .####[]
None Had an interview recently in which my interviewer said : UMUC , yeah - I've heard of them .####[]
None I see their ads on the metro all the time .####[]
None -but , I mean , is that even a real degree ?####[([10, 12], [8, 10], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]

None I am a single mother that works full time .####[]
None I have a degree in Aerospace Engineering and I must say , it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that school ( ANY school ) is what you make of it .####[]
None I received my bachelor's from Georgia Tech , which is ranked 2nd in the country for my undergraduate degree .####[]
None But with it's high rank and notable reputation , the students there are miserable and terribly unhappy .####[]
None Many are even deterred from their field by the experiences they had at the school .####[]
None However , I can say that though my experience was not always what I wanted , I made the best out of it .####[]
None There were students who cheated their way through GT and swore that was the only way to survive it .####[]
None There were students who received A's in classes that they didn't learn a single thing in , but flunked classes they learned the most in .####[]
None I personally never cheated and I made a personal effort to learn in every class , no matter what .####[]
None You can only get out what you put in .####[]
None To me , what made my experience at GT so difficult is that it is not geared in any fashion for the non-traditional student .####[]
None It was hard for me to work the amount of hours that I needed to work to support myself and my child AND go to class , which were only offered during the daytime .####[]
None Though I have not taken a class with UoP , I have rated it a 5 star because I think it's providing students like myself with a great opportunity to further their education without compromising their careers or family lives .####[([15, 16], [16, 17], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None I am going into the education field , and I am grateful for the UoP for offering a program that will allow me to teach , raise my child , AND get a Masters .####[]
None Can't beat that !####[]
None I enrolled in a degree program for a BA in Business Management .####[]
None This may be the biggest mistake I ever made .####[]
None I was completely upfront about my intentions to use my employee benefit to pay for the program .####[]
None Since I only get $8000/yr from my employer , this meant that I needed to stop taking classes in June of 2005 .####[]
None When I sent an email requesting to stop classes my advisor suggested I could be covered by 2 more since I had some personal problems and failed a couple of classes .####[]
None So I was encouraged to stick through 2 more classes .####[]
None She failed to disclose you can't simply do 2 classes you obligate to 4 classes . . . this means I would pay out of pocket for 2 classes at a rate of about $2500 .####[]
None To make matters worse . . .####[]
None I was told to apply for FASFA .####[]
None At first they say this does not obligate you to a student loan .####[]
None But somehow I ended up with one that got dispersed to them without my knowledge .####[]
None I am filing credit fraud against the school .####[]
None They say they have the money so it is theirs . . . and it's my problem how I resolve it .####[]

None I have learned more than I ever learned at my traditional school where I earned my A.S . I have done more work and retained more knowledge studying at UOP five hundred times more than I did at the other University's and Community Colleges I have attended .####[([30, 31], [24, 27], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None I think some people don't like to accept the fact that learning can be done via the Internet and satellite classrooms .####[]
None IT is strange though because they are probably the same people who are setting up web training and surveys within their company's .####[]
None It may be hard to accept for some but it is a growing discovery that humans are capable of learning without being hand fed the answers to everything ; we can be self-motivated and self-disciplined to the point of actually learning without an instructors face to their name or ever setting foot in a four walled room but in the convenience of our own offices and homes .####[]
None I would have never had the chance to further my education if I had to attend a ground campus for all my classes .####[]
None I have a son , husband , home , full-time job and life to live .####[]
None I only have the wee hours of the night to study and attend class and traditional schools do not offer this flexibility .####[]

None I know the future will only be filled with more students graduating from schools that have flexible schedules and advanced technology that allows them to provide such an atmosphere .####[]
None If traditional schools do not jump on the bandwagon they may find themselves short a few students .####[]
None Anyway , I loved my experience and my employer is SO happy for me to be graduating and they support UOP degrees 100% .####[([21], [23, 24], [19], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None I will no longer be passed up for a promotion due to not having a degree .####[]

None I just want to know if any one have there associates degree in health adminstration and how it helped get a better job ?####[]
None I am a recent UOP graduate now heading into my Master's degree program .####[]
None First let me say , some may think that UOP's credits are not transferrable , but to the contrary , the reason why some colleges refuses to accept the university's degree is simply out of intimidation .####[([29, 32], [35, 37], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None Their motives are to simply discourage people from attending the UOP because traditional colleges are losing grounds to colleges such as the UOP .####[([11], [5, 6], [1], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None As a matter of fact , many colleges/universities are now adopting to the UOP way of teaching by trying to make education more accommdating to working adults such as myself .####[([7, 9], [2, 6], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None Secondly , the myth about people not ever getting anything less than a C is strictly hear say , just ask the few students I know who has had to repeat their courses because of failed grades and slacking off .####[]
None ALthough the team environment may seem to be discouraging , I have had incidents where professors were notified of an individual's lack of participation and having seen that individual fail or have grades lowered for those same reasons .####[]
None Now I may not be an online student , as I've attended all but one of my classes in a regular classroom setting , but I have had to take one class online and it was not easy .####[([35, 36], [37, 39], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None I worked my butt off and received pre-class emails and regular feedbacks from my professor .####[]
None As UOP was NOT the only college that I've attended , I can safely say that there were no differences between meeting my academic requirements between the universities .####[([2, 3], [19, 20], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None I've also interviewed with many employers only to find that some of those managers were UOP graduates as well .####[]
None I believe that if the University of Phoenix was such a bad school as some try to implicate , many organizations , including the military would not invest their monies into sending their personnel their for educational enrichment .####[]
None I say that there will always be negative remarks about any college you attend .####[]
None As they say , you can please some of the people but not all .####[]

None The online class time is bennificial to those not already familiar with the subject matter .####[([1, 5], [5, 7], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None However , those of us that have been in the business environment for a few years can skip the live chat and skim over the transcripts to see if any interesting discussions were held .####[]
None Overall , I feel that this program is a good choice for those of us that do not have the time to attend a traditional college and that have put in a few years of work in the business sector .####[([10, 12], [10], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None However , I would not reccomend this to those fresh out of high school , or those who have never held a job .####[]
None As far as the high tuition , all online colleges are expensive .####[([5, 7], [5], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None CTU's tuition and fees are in-line with other online colleges that I researched .####[]
None The same degree at a brick-and-mortar college would have cost me about $5K less , but I would have had to go longer and drive an hour one way to attend class .####[]

None All of them have extremely poor writing skills , which says a lot about a person .####[]

None The more I searched , I realized that UoP was the only thing that was going to work with my current situation .####[([9, 10], [12, 14], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None I figured that a degree from a school with a bad reputation is better than no degree at all , so I enrolled .####[([7, 9], [11, 13], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None First of all , the enrollment counselors can be a little aggressive .####[([5, 8], [10, 11], [0], 'Negative', 'Weak')]
None I sent a request for information online and when the enrollment counselor called me , she tried to sign me up before answering any of my questions .####[]
None This is where you have to be a little aggressive yourself .####[]
None The first two classes were horrible .####[([3, 5], [5, 7], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None They were classes that just got you used to the online learning environment .####[]
None For people who are not used to computers or Internet forums , these classes would be great .####[([13, 14], [17, 18], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None I found them to be a waste of time and money .####[([3, 4], [7, 12], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None At the same time though , any college you attend , online or on campus will make you take classes you don't like in a degree program .####[]
None My academic and financial advisers have only changed once and do a much better job than the first ones .####[([3, 6], [13], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None Anytime I have a question they are very quick to answer and try to help whenever they can .####[([6, 7], [8], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None One thing you must understand about this school is that no one will hold your hand and make sure you do your work .####[([7, 9], [11, 12], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None You must be self-motivated .####[]
None Between work and the baby , I have to put myself on a schedule so that I do not procrastinate with my work but it is well worth it .####[]
None There is a lot of reading material and sometimes the work can be more tedious than challenging .####[([5, 8], [4, 5], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None Since this school is the only one ( that I know of anyway ) to let anyone attend with only a high school diploma or GED , you will have idiots in your class room with you .####[]
None I am not bothered by that at all .####[]
None Someone else's lack of education does not hinder my efforts in the least .####[]
None No one is asking you to be friends with them , just reply to their discussion question posts .####[]

None Yes , I've seen some people complete both master's and doctoral programs there ; however , these people had little , if any , experience in the real world and had very little to contribute to course discussions .####[]

None I've attended Devry in IL for almost a year and a half , and my experience has been very good .####[([15, 17], [19, 20], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None Every one of my professors has had a masters degree or higher , years of experience in the field related to the course material , and they have all been very personable and approachable .####[([4, 6], [31], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong'), ([4, 6], [31], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None The class sizes are small to medium , and the material covered is practical and relevant .####[([10, 11], [13, 15], [0], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([10, 11], [15, 17], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None Put simply , the tools for receiving a great education are there , and the environment is excellent .####[([15, 17], [17, 19], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None There is a lot of material covered in each class , and therefor a lot of work must be done to take full advantage of the time spent .####[]
None With that said the professors ( in my experience ) do show compassion and give a lot of open book tests .####[([4, 7], [12, 14], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None This does not however make for an easy A . People who do not do the work still struggle and receive bad grades .####[([1, 2], [3], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None My summary of the school is that you get what you put in , and there is ample opportunity to get a lot out .####[([4, 6], [18], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None However some people are able to coast by and then ruin it for everyone else after their dumb asses enter the workforce .####[]
None Now I find myself in the difficult situation of enjoying my school , but fearing a sub-par reputation may hamper my ambitions .####[([17, 19], [16, 17], [0], 'Negative', 'Average'), ([7, 9], [6, 7], [0], 'Negative', 'Average'), ([11, 13], [9, 11], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None So at the moment I am reluctantly weighing my options for transferring to a different school .####[]
None Up until now I was a big advocate of the way in which CTU finally started to get there act together .####[]
None However , recently in an attempt to pocket more money they have now switched all the students books to e-books .####[]
None They still charge the student the same cost as it would be for a hard cover .####[]
None Problem is this , half the time the books are not avaliable , you need to login everytime you need the books and half the chapters are missing .####[]
None The other change is these so called " Knowledge tests " .####[]
None These exams now are injected after each assighment .####[]
None They are tests that are suppose to test your knowledge of the topics discussed .####[]
None 'NOT TRUE " you will not get above a D+ on these tests .####[]
None They typically ask you questions that are not in the books , not in any of the teachings or anywhere in CTU's library .####[]
None CTU was on the right track but have now gone down hill .####[([1, 2], [10, 13], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None Chatting with other students , many have intentions of dropping out to pursue other university's .####[]
None CTU gets a huge amount of money and one has to ask for what . ?####[]
None If your considering a online college , I would advise you to stay away from CTU , too many changes that are not for the good of the student but for the college to make more profit .####[([19, 21], [23, 24], [0], 'Negative', 'Average'), ([19, 21], [18, 19], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None Sometimes I think they have these tests so that students flunk and then have to pay to take the course again .####[]
None Anybody who thinks UoP is a degree mill simply doesnt know what he or she is talking about .####[([4, 6], [2, 8], [0, 2], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None Those that complain the most are often people who attended other b-schools and think graduates from UoP are slackers and somehow lowering standards overall .####[]
None Uop is not Harvard , and none of us think that , but we also work very , very hard for what were earning .####[]
None The whole for profit thing is a red herring .####[]
None All schools are out to make a profit and none of them can operate without income .####[]
None I have finished 11 of my 15 MBA classes at UoP and I have a 3.85 GPA .####[]
None Although I know there are many other schools with stellar reputations and much higher standards , my life stage dictated that I attend a school that could cater to my work hours and pressures .####[]
None I would have never been able to get a grad degree while the sole breadwinner and co-parent to four kids .####[]
None Combine that with the fact that I am in my early forties and the possibilities for continuing education were very limited .####[]
None My job would never have allowed for me to take daytime hours to get an MBA and night classes are not available anywhere near where I live .####[]
None I wish I could have gone a different route but I could never pass the GMAT without extensive tutoring .####[]
None Also , after reviewing the substance of the GMAT , I realized that it would never measure ANY skills needed for my career .####[]
None As it stands , more and more respectable b-schools are dropping the GMAT requirement because theyre coming to the same conclusion I did , specifically , that the GMAT is a very poor indicator of who will be a good grad school student .####[]
None Pre-tests like SATs and GMATs are designed to be more exclusive than much else .####[]
None They dont measure a persons intellect , only what they may or may not have learned up to that point , but never what they are capable of learning down the road .####[]
None My SATs scores were very average but during my undergrad years , I went on to be a Phi Beta Kappa candidate , sit on the deans list multiple times , and get a BFA with honors from one of the most prestigious design schools in the world .####[]
None The curriculum there is affectionately referred to as medical school without the blood .####[]
None It makes top-notch b-schools look easy because there were no correct answers , only subjective opinions about students work .####[]
None I know tough , and UoP asks for plenty from its students .####[([6, 7], [7, 10], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None This online university is just that .####[]
None It fits my schedule , I don't have to be logged in at any particular time and I get EXCELLENT customer sevice .####[([1, 2], [2, 6], [0], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([20, 23], [19, 20], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None The professors e-mail you , the school checks in to be sure you're ok with the next set of courses .####[]
None AND they share their experiences about the classes they've had and what you might be going into .####[]
None This is what an online univerisity experience is all about .####[]
None To put the icing on the cake they are regionally accredited !####[]
None Job Well Done , Jones !####[([5, 6], [2, 4], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None I'm in my second block of classes , and to be perfectly honest the classes are way way too easy .####[([14, 16], [19, 21], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None I was enrolled at my local community college for one semester , and decided to transfer to UoP because it would be more convenient .####[]
None Staff I would rate a 3/5 , they are courteous , but can take a long time to respond .####[([1, 2], [9, 11], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None Grading I rate a 0/5 , they grade much too easily , I have never been good at english , I'm a math/science person , I have failed english and writing courses several times , and I got a 96% at the end of the semester .####[]
None The grading is TOO LENIENT !####[]
None I don't know about transfering the credits out , but I am going to check into it soon at the community college , sacrificing a good education for convenience is just not worth it for me .####[]
None But for all those out there that wish to have a degree that is worth less than a real degree , " to each his own "####[]
None I am the President and CEO of a large firm in New York .####[]
None The required skills of my employees , and of the rest of the emerging workforce , are almost always seen by in a University of Phoenix graduate .####[]
None I will not simply promote someone who has a degree , but I will weigh the Phoenix graduate more heavily ; my experience in dealing with them permits me to make such generalizations .####[]
None From past experience , they demonstrate the ability to work with technology and have excellent communication skills .####[]
None Being forced to use the computer , be independent , and work with fellow students each day , is the closest " real-world " approach to Education I have seen in my thirty years in Business .####[([26, 28], [22, 24], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None It always peaks my curiosity when I read comments about the University of Phoenix Online being too easy .####[]
None Has it ever occurred to you that you already possess those very skills that I just mentioned ?####[]
None Or , on the other hand , do you even hold a degree ?####[]
None Since other individuals have found it necessary to comment on whether or not UoP offers a quality education , I'm hoping that at least someone is interested to hear from a qualified individual .####[]
None I will say simply this much , I encourage continuing education and offer tuition reimbursement of up to 15 credits per year ; University of Phoenix online and Walden are the only two programs I will offer this reimbursement to my over one thousand employees .####[]
None I take this all rather personally because many graduates successfuly run sectors of my company ; frankly , many of you are simply clueless .####[]
None It's funny and irritating all at the same time .####[]
None Yet , I truly don't care , since you won't be on my payroll .####[]
None As an end note , I went to a community college for my undergrad and obtained my MBA from New York University .####[]
None I was enrolled at UOP for a single class and quickly realized it was a complete waste of time and money .####[([13, 14], [15, 16], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None The group projects were unbelievable , the subject matter completely useless , and the instructor was less than helpful , not to mention 2yrs later I am still getting spam mail from UOP .####[([7, 9], [9, 10], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None I ended up going to AIU Online , which has a 100% better format and layout .####[]
None Unfortunately that completely useless class I took at UOP won't transfer to anything else .####[([5, 6], [2, 3], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
None Also UOP had tacked on an extra yr to my degree due to missing Associates level courses , however AIU let me complete all of the missing credits using CLEP tests .####[]
None Thanks to AIU I graduate with my BSIT in 5 more wks .####[]
None This supposedly military friendly school scammed me .####[([4, 5], [5, 8], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong'), ([4, 5], [1, 2], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None CTU was extremely helpful at first and I enjoyed the classes while at the same time was challenged by them .####[([10, 11], [8, 10], [0], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([10, 11], [17, 19], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None One complaint I have is that I was put into a program where I was not allowed to choose my classes .####[([11, 12], [1, 3], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None It may have changed but there was a preset list of classes I had to take despite already having credit in some of them .####[]
None I had multiple units in Computer Science and Networking as I had been doing it in the military for 6 years at the time .####[]
None CTU was still trying to get me to take 101 .####[]
None After about 2 semesters , I was deployed to an area without internet access because of military duties .####[]
None Since classes already started , CTU told me they would extend me so that I could complete the classes and get credit once I got back .####[]
None What they failed to tell me is in order to extend , I also had to be enrolled in the next semester .####[]
None By the time I got back from my deployment , I had racked up 2 full time semesters worth of fees and no credits to show for it .####[]
None I called the school to explain the situation I was in and thought it was taken care of .####[]
None When I enrolled in another school , they even released my transcripts which isn't supposed to happen if you owe them money .####[]
None Next thing I know , there's a letter in the mail from a collection agency saying I still owe CTU the money .####[]
None This is 3 years later .####[]
None They NEVER contacted me in that whole 3 year period .####[]
None If you can complete the program without problems or having to take any breaks , go for it .####[]
None Just be sure to read between the lines in dealing with any school belonging to Career Education Corporation .####[]
None There are several under federal investigation .####[]
None Read this : http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/01/31/60minutes/main670479.shtml####[]
None If you are a veteran , go to American Military University ( AMU ) .####[]
None In my personal opinion , the experience with AMU has been much more satisfying .####[]
None For a program that serves a lot of military personnel , I didn't find degree programs that supported my military career .####[]
None Telephone calls and e-mail to Maryland personnel were not responded to .####[]
None That telephone just rang and rang and rang .####[]
None Other universities offered better choices in terms of majors , and transfer credit for military personnel .####[]
None So , eventually I went with another program .####[]
None I think one can only suck it up and drive on for so long before getting fed up and moving on .####[]
None Sorry UMUC , you don't provide quality services for the money you expect .####[([2, 3], [5], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
None I'm near completing my Bachelor's degree and I've done it online .####[]
None I will be graduating soon , but that's part of the story .####[]
None I can't say enough for the education progam and the support received .####[([6, 7], [2, 5], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None The courses are not easy , however , they are not difficult either .####[([1, 3], [4, 5], [0], 'Negative', 'Weak'), ([9, 10], [11], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None I like the idea of how the online schedule works around your schedule , and not the other way around .####[([8, 9], [2, 3], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None I can miss a day or two and still catch up .####[]
None The hours are 24-7 , therefore , I can enter a leave whenever I wish .####[]
None There are mandatory meetings , however , very few .####[]
None I've rated the professors and staff in the high 90% .####[]
None They usually respond quickly , and are well informed .####[([1], [1, 2], [0], 'Positive', 'Weak'), ([1], [8, 10], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None Now , there are minor times when something does not go right , but nothing is 100%####[]
None The school material can either be purchased or extracted from the services .####[]
None Personally , I think this school offers one of the most unique programs systems available , and one that anyone with a little determination can do .####[]
None As mentioned before , I'll be graduating soon , and have decided to continue into their graduate program at Keller .####[]
None If all goes well , I'll have my Master's in less than one year .####[]
None To sum my experience with DeVrt , " SUPER . "####[]
None I have heard nothing but good things about the university of phoenix online .####[([9, 12], [3, 6], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None I don't know why people see online learning as some sort of lesser form of education , it takes alot more dedication , skills and intelligence to succeed at an online degreee .####[]
None I took some online courses before and I loved it .####[]
None I just finished my Bachelor of Science/Business Management at UOP and I am now getting ready to start the MBA program at UOP .####[]
None I started as a junior having gone to community college prior .####[]
None The 22 months that it took me on ground were the best times of my life .####[([5, 6], [11, 17], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None The Sacramento Valley campus has some of the most remarkable instructors I have ever had .####[]
None I have 18 years of work experience in my field and the learning environment that University of Phoenix provides is far more relative to business than a traditional college .####[([15, 18], [21, 22], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
None The students not only have to learn to work together in teams , but also learn how to present learned material .####[]
None The students get the opportunity to be good at public speaking .####[([1, 3], [8, 9], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None Compared to the traditional " cram for exams " , the UOP student must learn the material enough to present in front of the class ; not to mention the many , many research papers that are required in each of the courses .####[([12, 14], [14, 17], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
None As a hiring manager , I would lean more toward someone with a degree from University of Phoenix than one from a state university .####[([15, 19], [8, 9], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
None I'm going to Valdosta U in GA .####[]
None Your courses get called off too many times .####[([1, 3], [6, 7], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]

None Oh yeah , I wasn't too crazy about the quality of your professors .####[([12, 14], [4, 7], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]

None My last UMUC course did not meet the course description and goals , and it was a second choice bcause the first choice got called off .####[([3, 5], [6, 7], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
