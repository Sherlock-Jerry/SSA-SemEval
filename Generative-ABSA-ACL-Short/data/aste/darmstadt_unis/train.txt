NA The experience at UOP has been nothing but a hassle .####[([4], [7, 8], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]

NA I recently left the military and began using my G.I Bill for college .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA When I enrolled , I opted to use my military money to pay for classes , but signed up for financial aid to defer the payment until my G.I . Bill took affect .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA When my government money began to come in , I called the university to see what needed to be done .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I was told multiple times that because I was approved for aid through the university , the G.I . Bill money was mine to keep for personal use , and I was covered for eight classes .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA After being told this several times , I thought that things were in order .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA WRONG !####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I was recently handed a bill of almost $6,000.00 .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA The woman responsible for this was apparently discharged from the university , but they will not take the hit for this terrible mistake .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA So , after hearing negative stories about some of their programs not being accredited , and actually reading on the internet that they do not offer accredited online courses , degrees , or programs , this has shown me that the University of Phoenix is nothing more than a criminal hoax .####[([42, 44], [46, 48], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]

NA If it was so bad , than you should have dropped out the moment you felt it was going wrong !####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA At least than you could have went to your university of choice where I am sure your money will be well accepted there as it will be anywhere .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Problem is you did not have the grades or time to attend the University of your choice like Stanford , Harvard , Yale , ETC .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA So , you had to go a university where the prestige may not be where it is as compared to the schools mentioned but to me seem to provide a pretty good education .####[([8], [13], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
NA Get over it ! ! Put your bad experience on yourself .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA Also seems he or she did not have the grades before to attend that university prior to him being accepted by UofP .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA More than likely this whiner found someone he or she thought was to stupid to go school , had a degree from UofP and decided to downgrade their degree based on this person .####[([29], [27], [5], 'Negative', 'Average')]
NA Any way smart person , there are plenty of unknown small universities out there you can go to .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA It is your responsibility to find out which programs are accredited and which ones are not .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Accreditation too has it's standards on who they accredit like do they have a big plushy office on the campus , are they allowed to have free meals , do they have box seats at the big game when they come to town ?####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA If you did not see that one coming then you truly need to go back to school .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I spent time researching and quite a few fellow employees told me the UOP was great .####[([14], [16], [10], 'Positive', 'Average')]
NA Well , I have not attended a class yet , and I am thinking of not , tomorrow night is orientation night .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA The reason why is because of the lack of response from the counselor's and how they avoid any questions you may have in regards to the items they are charging you for .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I was suppose to have the application fee waived .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Well , the online counslor pissed me off so bad , I refused to attend .####[([4, 5], [10], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
NA Then we deducted the application fee from my tutition fee and did not refund the entire amount to me .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA So I spoke to an on-campus representive , who doesn't answer my e-mails/and a financial counselor who calls me at home when I am at work .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Now , I can finally see that I am enrolled in a class , but of course they want $1345 now .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA There is a resource charge of $70.00 and I have to ask what that is for .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA I am thinking about finishing my BSIT on campus because I would like more hands on experience .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Two out of the three colleges that I went to said that they would accept the credits that I earned at CTU online .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I think that speaks for itself .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Online schooling isn't for everyone .####[([1, 2], [3, 5], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
NA You need to be able to manage your time effectively .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA A lot of students have problems with this .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA If this is your case , I suggest going to on campus school .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA If you've never attended CTU , please do not talk bad about it .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA They are regional accredited .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA My experience :####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA The Pros : the course sequence in my masters was well-planned .####[([5], [11], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]

NA Most of my fellow program students were sincere , smart , hard working people .####[([6], [8], [0], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([6], [10], [0], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([6], [12, 13], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
NA Every now and then , someone would flake out , but this was usually do to things going on in their work/personal lives .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA And having worked on professional teams in non-academia , I have not found it to be much differrent .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I would say about 4/5 teachers were competent professionals and hard-working teachers .####[([12], [11], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]

NA The Cons : The weekly assignments require rigid discipline .####[([6], [8], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
NA We all had day jobs in the MIS program , and coming home after 10+ hours to spend 1-2 hours writing discussion question answers was not what I would have preferred .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA But that's the discipline you accept if you want an advanced degree while you're working .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA One or two of my courses were just lousy ( Programming and Project Management--yet I got an A and a B+ respectively , so I'm not saying this out of misplaced resentment ) .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Overall : I think it's worth the money .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA I really think that the topic of UOP is 50-50 ; it goes both ways and there will never be a wrong or a right answer .####[([8], [2], [0], 'Neutral', 'Strong')]
NA It is an opinion and I find it hard to believe that people who attended one class can bad mouth the school ( Some don't even make it through one class , they drop out 2 weeks into it ) .####[([13], [9, 11], [0], 'Negative', 'Average'), ([22], [19, 20], [13], 'Negative', 'Average')]
NA A bad situation can happen to anyone , and perhaps this resulted in a cost of a lot of money for that person , but I think that , that goes for everything .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA If one were to have a bad experience , especially for the first time trying something new , it would appear as something that doesn't work for you .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA Veterans should stay away from Phoenix , as they will not receive the full benefit of the GI Bill .####[([6], [3, 4], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]

NA Likes : - On hands training ( a lot of lab work ) - Some very knowledgeable experts were my professors ( this matters because you learn best from those who have real world knowledge , and not just from an individual with a masters or phd and no real world experience ; and yes more of my professors had obtained their phds ) - very good guidance and counseling on what courses will be required and what courses mesh well with certain other courses taken during the semester Dislikes : - expensive as hell , at least for a tech school - the university has more of a business approach ; rather , than a campus to serve the students approach - too many units in one semester ( if you are on the accelerated program ) - you don't get the same atmosphere as other universities ie . parties , sports teams , or hot chicks ( lets face it hot girls don't want to become engineers ) From my experience during my attendance at DeVry , I noticed only two types of students ; those who want a piece of paper that states they are engineers , and those who actually strive at becoming engineers because they know their future livelihood will depend on it .####[([178], [94, 95], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong'), ([126], [124, 125], [0], 'Negative', 'Average'), ([21], [16], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]

NA The only thing that I can assume is that some professors are leanient on citations is do to the fact that some students have been out of college for over 10 years or more , so they are not up to par with what should be done for citations .####[([11], [10], [0], 'Negative', 'Weak')]

NA A lack of oversight from my mentor resulting in many mis-steps and dead ends , months of delays in the development of my proposal because of the same , and a continuously-frustrating lack of " connect " between the guidelines that Capella's School of Human Services provided at the time , and what my committee was even aware of-in the end I withdrew out of frustration .####[([42], [2, 4], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
