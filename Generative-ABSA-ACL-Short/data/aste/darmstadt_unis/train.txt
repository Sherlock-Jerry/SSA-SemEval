NA I decided to finish my education with a online school after 8 years of attending a State Uni .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I had a serious problem with the state uni , I was never able to get into any of my classes , due to time constraints , I worked fulltime all the way through school , and because freshman had priority on all GE classes .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA What this equaled was 8 years of college , all GEs except math complete and my major classes were never scheduled so I could attend .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I ended up taking 2 classes a semester because I due to the state colleges bureaucracy I was never able to find or enroll in classes that would work with a fulltime schedule .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA My biggest fear was that if I ever finished school I would never even use my degree , after all , at the time I was working in a retail store with several college grads doing the same thing as me .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I entered AIU with a beginners level in computers .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I had worked with some programming but not much .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA The classes were laid out in a progressive manner , as with math you need to have a foundation before you can start building on it and AIU took this into account .####[([2], [8], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
NA My instructors were well versed in the subjects they taught and had just as many if not more office hours than , my State Uni , that they could be approached for help .####[([2], [4, 5], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
NA Because it is an accelerated program the classes move fast and it is very easy to fall behind .####[([8], [14], [0], 'Neutral', 'Strong'), ([8], [10], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
NA If you are considering AIU you will need to be ready to apply yourself in order to get the work done , because no room for procrastinators here !####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA The course work was very challenging and I really walked away from this school with an education I can apply to my everyday life .####[([2, 3], [5], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]

NA With further communication with my HR department I've come to the conclusion that if you didn't just purchase your degree but you earned it by learning and expressing your skill and abilities you and your degree are credible to any company .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA If a company does not accept my degree , without seeing my ability I would not want to work for such a bias company .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Keep in mind my company is strict in every process especially being a Public traded company that complies with the all the public company acts .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA If I can get the job at college-graduate starting salaries , plus 3 promotions in a year without any degree from any school and just a dimploma , I know without any doubt that with a degree from Devry I can move around and have better leverage with other companies .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA From what I saw and hear , you surely earn your degree at Devry , you must pass the class with a C to earn the credits , its only a year shorter than a typical 4 year program at a local college , and such a fast-paced career-oriented education is offered .####[([14], [48], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
NA If you want to go to college to receive that " college-life " or to get the " personality " , " character " , etc that a college campus and life gives you then go to a local university or high-held prestige school .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA But if you already know your career path , already have character and pesonality in your life , then Devry is a good option to consider .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I plan on going to their Keller graduate school to get an MBA after my bachelors because on year of your bachelors counts for one year of earning your masters and so you only have one year left to finish your masters !####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA As the president of the ASB at the Long Beach campus I have had very many mixed feelings when it comes to DeVry . . . Im a 7th term Computer Engineering Technology major and I really think that devry has kind of gone through alot of problems ever since their " hay-day " back in the mid-late ninties...for any prospective students , here is my pro/con list for you : //----------------------------- // // PROS // //----------------------------- ---small class sizes , on the average your classes will have between 6 - 15 students . . . usually on the smaller side .####[([79, 80], [78], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
NA that doesnt sound like much , but even if your professor sucks , at least hes only ten feet away rather than 400 in a lecture hall ---expedient education devry uses a trimester based system , which means that you only have 6 weeks off for the whole year ; however , you graduate in three if you take the standard course load of 17.68 units per tri ---abet/tac accreditation devry has had accreditation for a long time now and here at the long beach campus , abet tac gave us the longest accreditation that they offer .####[([29], [28], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
NA ---job placement i had two friends last semester that graduated with 3.5 and 3.9 and both were offered engineering positions that offered their starting pay at 50k and 65k respectively there are tons of jobs for us CET's and EET's...that if you work hard in them your looking at 6-figure salaries within 10 years easily //----------------------------- // // CONS // //----------------------------- ---bad profs while almost every school has em....we seem to draw them like flies .####[([63], [62], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]

NA ---business run academic institution alot of the decisions as to classes are made with a business mentality when they should be made with an educational one .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA course changes , student activites , even outsourcing the bookstore are all run with a business-like , bottom-line driven mentality ---the cost i dont even need to explain this one ; however let me tell you that if you actually read the quarterly reports that are sent to devry's stakeholders , you will find the following in thier recent statistics : online , night time , and weekend enrollment is up 29% from last year while full-time day student enrollment is down porportionally .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA this tells us one of two things either students are switching from daytime to the others , or new students are coming as fast as the old ones are leaving .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA why would they do this ? its MUCH cheaper to attend any other way than full-time mind you it will probably take 2 to 4 times longer to fulfill your degree requirements .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA What was my experience during the dissertation process ?####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA A lack of oversight from my mentor resulting in many mis-steps and dead ends , months of delays in the development of my proposal because of the same , and a continuously-frustrating lack of " connect " between the guidelines that Capella's School of Human Services provided at the time , and what my committee was even aware of-in the end I withdrew out of frustration .####[([42], [2, 4], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]

NA Collage will teach the basics and the roots people need to understand to then take more specific training ( by the company ) on the actual work to be performed .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I don't think UOP should be deminish because of some people that think they're the smartest people on earth , nor for people that didn't appreciate the value of going to school and earn a bachelor's degree from the conform of the home with flexible schedule .####[([4], [2], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]

NA I am considering going to Devry to further my education in either ECT , CET , or CIS while still in active duty in the US Navy .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I'm an Aviation Electronics Technician , and I currently have 7 years experience working with electronic / mission systems , radar , micro-electronics , test benches , aircraft electronics and systems , etc , etc , - my question is...I have read that DeVry isn't so well suited for a " first degree " ( ie , someone right out of high school ) .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA By the time I get out of the Navy , I'll have 10 years work experience in the electronics / computer field .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA I work in the field as a software engineer ; graduated in 2004 and have been employed since .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Likes : - On hands training ( a lot of lab work ) - Some very knowledgeable experts were my professors ( this matters because you learn best from those who have real world knowledge , and not just from an individual with a masters or phd and no real world experience ; and yes more of my professors had obtained their phds ) - very good guidance and counseling on what courses will be required and what courses mesh well with certain other courses taken during the semester Dislikes : - expensive as hell , at least for a tech school - the university has more of a business approach ; rather , than a campus to serve the students approach - too many units in one semester ( if you are on the accelerated program ) - you don't get the same atmosphere as other universities ie . parties , sports teams , or hot chicks ( lets face it hot girls don't want to become engineers ) From my experience during my attendance at DeVry , I noticed only two types of students ; those who want a piece of paper that states they are engineers , and those who actually strive at becoming engineers because they know their future livelihood will depend on it .####[([178], [94, 95], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong'), ([126], [124, 125], [0], 'Negative', 'Average'), ([21], [16], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]

NA I just received my MIS in IT Management and I have to say I feel that I accomplished something of personal significance .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Yet , as with any academic institution , there are pros and cons .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA My experience :####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA The Pros : the course sequence in my masters was well-planned .####[([5], [11], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
NA By the last class , I had a new vocabulary and pretty much the rudiments of a new skill set ( I work in education and had little background in information systems , yet I was able to get up to speed relatively quickly ) .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Most of my fellow program students were sincere , smart , hard working people .####[([6], [8], [0], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([6], [10], [0], 'Positive', 'Average'), ([6], [12, 13], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
NA Every now and then , someone would flake out , but this was usually do to things going on in their work/personal lives .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA And having worked on professional teams in non-academia , I have not found it to be much differrent .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I would say about 4/5 teachers were competent professionals and hard-working teachers .####[([12], [11], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
NA That is pretty good for any school in my opinion .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA The Cons : The weekly assignments require rigid discipline .####[([6], [8], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
NA We all had day jobs in the MIS program , and coming home after 10+ hours to spend 1-2 hours writing discussion question answers was not what I would have preferred .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA But that's the discipline you accept if you want an advanced degree while you're working .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA One or two of my courses were just lousy ( Programming and Project Management--yet I got an A and a B+ respectively , so I'm not saying this out of misplaced resentment ) .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Overall : I think it's worth the money .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA The promise of the UoP was a great motivator into enrolling at UoP .####[([2, 5], [8, 9], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
NA I tried attending a traditional university in the past , for my second degree , and it was too difficult given my work schedule .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA What the UoP offers to career adults , with the promise of flexible education , is great .####[([3], [17], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
NA The execution has been less so .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA I have the following issues : 1 . Quality of students .####[([9, 11], [2, 5], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
NA I had student in my class who could not communicate and had little understanding of English .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Some students could not understand the material and had such poor spelling and grammar , that I could not believe they were graduate students .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA They also did not work at the level of a graduate student 2 . Instructors .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Some instructors were quite poor , and do not supply lectures or proper feedback on work .####[([2], [4], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
NA 3 . High costs .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Twice , I have experienced tuition increases .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Although this happens at traditional universities as well , the program is relatively quite expensive compared to a traditional university , which requires physical facilities .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA 4 . Poor quality overall .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Too easy to get an A . You can slide your way to an A with little effort .####[([4, 6], [1], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
NA I purposely did not submit work , with the expectation that I would not get an A , only to be surprised .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Overall , I would not recommend the UoP for anyone at this time , unless the program and way it is managed changes .####[([8], [5], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
NA The goals marketed to the public are correct ( flexible , adult education ) , but the corporate goals of the Apollo Group conflict with the goals of an educational institution .####[([19], [24], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
NA It is possible to get some knowledge from the program , but this requires the student to read all the materials .####[([10], [3], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
NA Otherwise , a student can obtain a high grade with little effort .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA My Master's in Information Technology at UMUC stings as one of the great bad investments of my life .####[([7], [8], [0], 'Negative', 'Average'), ([7], [14], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
NA The whole experience was so utterly fraudulent on so many levels .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA Egregious plagiarism was the name of the game : Professors regularly regurgitate curricula and lectures from prior semesters .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA Power Point is considered an acceptable format for term papers !####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA No thesis required for a Masters degree .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA And the anonymity of online study , already a huge obstacle to an edifying experience , is I believe actively promoted by UMUC for the simple reason that its impossible to criticize when you cant organize .####[([23], [19], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
NA I recall one class in which our instructor logged in ( and this is not an exaggeration ) twice during the semester : once to greet everyone and once to collect our final exams .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Four or five of us managed to overcome the anonymity of our chat rooms to take action : a formal letter to the administration which went totally unanswered .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I guess what I find most depressing is the thought of people pursuing their undergraduate degrees at UMUC .####[([18], [6], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
NA Having gone to a traditional University for my Bachelor's , I simply cannot imagine a graduate of UMUC's Web Tycho interface having experienced anything substantive .####[([24], [25], [16], 'Neutral', 'Strong')]
NA And it may sound elitist , but it just seems depressing to think of tens of thousands ( a href=http://www.umuc.edu/ip/umucfacts_02.html ) of people walking around , thinking they've learned anything more than how to manipulate a web interface .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA That UMUC is accredited raises some serious questions about the state of academia and the trend towards distance education .####[([2], [5, 8], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
NA And I do suspect that these problems are not unique to UMUC .####[([12], [4], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
NA High-bandwidth distance education , through which real bonds , expectations and communication can take place , might work some day .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA But the current state of distance education is just too shallow , but promoted by an educational system too strapped for cash and a community of working adults , too strapped for time .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA UMUC's WebTycho interface is at best a pretend classroom with a few clever javascripts and java applets to entertain you while you wait months for feedback on that paper you're now starting to feel embarrassed for having taken so seriously .####[([1], [5, 6], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
NA You'll learn though , and by the end of your program , you'll find you needn't even bother buying the textbooks and you can get by with a couple manic hours of copying and pasting once or twice a semester .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Had an interview recently in which my interviewer said : UMUC , yeah - I've heard of them .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I see their ads on the metro all the time .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA -but , I mean , is that even a real degree ?####[([11], [8, 10], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]

NA I received my bachelor's from Georgia Tech , which is ranked 2nd in the country for my undergraduate degree .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA But with it's high rank and notable reputation , the students there are miserable and terribly unhappy .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Many are even deterred from their field by the experiences they had at the school .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA However , I can say that though my experience was not always what I wanted , I made the best out of it .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA There were students who cheated their way through GT and swore that was the only way to survive it .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA There were students who received A's in classes that they didn't learn a single thing in , but flunked classes they learned the most in .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I personally never cheated and I made a personal effort to learn in every class , no matter what .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA You can only get out what you put in .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA To me , what made my experience at GT so difficult is that it is not geared in any fashion for the non-traditional student .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA It was hard for me to work the amount of hours that I needed to work to support myself and my child AND go to class , which were only offered during the daytime .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Though I have not taken a class with UoP , I have rated it a 5 star because I think it's providing students like myself with a great opportunity to further their education without compromising their careers or family lives .####[([14], [16, 17], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
NA I am going into the education field , and I am grateful for the UoP for offering a program that will allow me to teach , raise my child , AND get a Masters .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA I was completely upfront about my intentions to use my employee benefit to pay for the program .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Since I only get $8000/yr from my employer , this meant that I needed to stop taking classes in June of 2005 .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA When I sent an email requesting to stop classes my advisor suggested I could be covered by 2 more since I had some personal problems and failed a couple of classes .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA So I was encouraged to stick through 2 more classes .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA She failed to disclose you can't simply do 2 classes you obligate to 4 classes . . . this means I would pay out of pocket for 2 classes at a rate of about $2500 .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA To make matters worse . . .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

I have done more work and retained more knowledge studying at UOP five hundred times more than I did at the other University's and Community Colleges I have attended .####[([30], [25, 27], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
NA I think some people don't like to accept the fact that learning can be done via the Internet and satellite classrooms .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA IT is strange though because they are probably the same people who are setting up web training and surveys within their company's .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA It may be hard to accept for some but it is a growing discovery that humans are capable of learning without being hand fed the answers to everything ; we can be self-motivated and self-disciplined to the point of actually learning without an instructors face to their name or ever setting foot in a four walled room but in the convenience of our own offices and homes .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA First let me say , some may think that UOP's credits are not transferrable , but to the contrary , the reason why some colleges refuses to accept the university's degree is simply out of intimidation .####[([30, 31], [36], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
NA Their motives are to simply discourage people from attending the UOP because traditional colleges are losing grounds to colleges such as the UOP .####[([11], [6], [1], 'Negative', 'Average')]

NA Secondly , the myth about people not ever getting anything less than a C is strictly hear say , just ask the few students I know who has had to repeat their courses because of failed grades and slacking off .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
