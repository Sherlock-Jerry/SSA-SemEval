NA But for my own personal reason's I really want to go back to school and receive a degree .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I've been speaking with this one counselor for several month's now from UOP and he calls me once or twice a week to know if I am still going to enroll in the classes for " Associate of Arts in Business " ?####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I tell him yes but inside I am saying ? ? ? ? ? ? because I have been burned before by a so called " training school " that made several promises for the job market today in the Medical Field with hard work and your diploma/certificate .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA But I got nothing in the end , but smart mouth teacher's , a letter to pay for my own Graduation and a bill to receive my Diploma .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA Don't get me wrong , I know that some things and places are what you make it but If I am paying for it , I want it to pay off , and not just get the money and run .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Quick story in regards to the school I went to for that Medical Diploma , while on my job at the Hospital , I decided to tell the school that I needed them to fax over my resume for a position at the Hospital without letting them know I already worked there .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Because this was one of the schools requirements to help the students find medical positions , well can you believe that the school faxed over 35 resumes of other students and not one was mine .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA Lastly if none of these options meet your needs ( I think you should re-evaluate your needs but ! ) by all means check out a private school such as DEVRY .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA What makes my opinion any better or worse than those others posted on this site ?####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Well , lets see I am a 95 , DEVRY graduate of the Phoenix , AZ . USA , BSEET curriculum .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I am also a Retired Naval officer worked in the electronics field for 39 years now as a technician .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA As an officer I have had some management experience and have associated with other managers so I understand how they think .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Much is made of DEVRYs , mainly by DEVRY , heavily hands-on focus .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA As a manager hiring an engineer , I would be more interested in depth of knowledge and understanding of the principles of engineering and science , and the ability to bring those principles to bear on problem solving rather than the ability to actually build the device .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I have others , usually titled Technicians , to which I assign the duties of fabrication and testing .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Lastly : I havent looked at DEVRYs curriculum in years .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I found it to be pretty easy .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA It was thorough but it didnt tax my military electronics training too much .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA That may be because a BSEET degree is not an engineering degree .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA It is a Technician Degree .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA BS EETs generally serve as engineering technicians not engineers .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA That is left to those who have years of experience and or those with a minimum of a BSEE degree .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA They get your money and then screw you out of a real education .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I made straight A's at UoP but the instructors I had for all my classes gave no feed back , no weekly grades(so you had no idea if you was actually learning the material correctly or not ) and financial couslor was a joke !####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA She would not return phone calls or emails .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA This college lacks too much to risk your hard earned money...find another college and seriously research them before joining ! ! To stanford : I made straight A's at UoP . . UoP's biggest problem is they are too big , hire instructors with full plates already to instruct , and lack financial aide that helps with book costs .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Their program for financial aide is screwed up ! ! ! AND I bet since you work at a hospital...you get employer repayment or at least half your tutition paid .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA A lot of people who haven't had the problems MOST of us have had....they were not fitting the entire bill therefore had no worries .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA I have felt like giving up before , but the school of B and Tkept pushing me .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA The dissertation process was the hardest thing that I have ever done , mentally ( and I have done several demanding tasks in the US Army ) .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA It wasn't hard from the " Capella sucks " mindset...but from the " you can't just walk in there , pay your money , and get your degree " mindset .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA For those who have that mindset about Capella , you need to be put away for insanity ( or for frivolous motivations ) .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA Mom and dad couldn't pony up for me to go off to school right out of HS ( not that there is anything wrong with that just making a point ) .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA When I got out of the Army , I had started a family and a career , so the act of going to school ( even part time ) was hard .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA But I did it with my BS and MS .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Something that I have learned about these people with pessimism towards Capella is that they are on tilt , have had their " wittle " feelings hurt by the process , or just are down right mad/ jealous that there are other options than the traditional B and M route ( of which my BS and MS are from B and M schools ) .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA With all that praise said , and to show my non-partisanship towards Capella , I will state that I feel they over advertise on mediums such as the Internet , which brings down the " shine " in a sense .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Also , they do need to start putting forth some more stringent standards on acceptance...i.e...GMAT scores , etc .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA AND of course the cost...it isnt cheap !####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Just MHO .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA Anyone wanting to just sit through a degree without having to get involved can attend any traditional institution , but with Capella and her sister school Univ .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
