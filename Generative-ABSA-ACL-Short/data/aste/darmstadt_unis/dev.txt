NA So , now I will leave my original comment about Capella .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA My gripe has to do with the initial contact I personally experienced at Capella University####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I contacted Capella because I was interested in online learning .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Capella did not fulfill a simple request that I had made to them .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA The request was to let me speak to someone who is currently in one of their graduate programs .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I asked twice and they did not send someone to contact me like they told me they would .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I have to start putting together my applications for graduate school by the end of the summer and I waited and waited but received no response to my request .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I found Capella to be very unprofessional with the way they handled this .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA This does not bode well for the school .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I hate bad service .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I wondered why they didn't have anyone that I could speak with ?####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Other schools have plenty of references that I am able to contact .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I ultimately saw this as a blessing because I am no longer pursuing this school anymore .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Because of my experience , I feel it's important to let others know about it .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA My initial experience with Capella wasn't good .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA This led me to look at what others are saying and " some " are saying that the school is lousy from their experiences also and they are currently in the program .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA This did not surprise me .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Some of these students are also on there way to PhDs .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Buyer Beware- Look around at the other reviews and ratings before you invest your hard earned time and money .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Just google Capella and ratings or reviews and then you can make a more informed decision before you invest . .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Besides , of course I have a Marxist Perspective when it comes to Capella .####[([14], [9], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
NA Why are there are no entrance requirements and 100% acceptance rate .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Gee , I wonder why that is ?####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA I keep having to call the IRS ( which i've never had to do ) to request info from them and then having them say 'well we've never had a school request something like that....' .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Overall , i'm left with having doubts of even attending this school because I haven't even started attending classes yet and i'm already having this much trouble and its causing so much stress .####[([11, 12], [6, 7], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]

NA The medium of instruction deserves some improvement , but otherwise , I think it has all the pros and cons of any regular F2F university .####[([4], [6], [0], 'Negative', 'Weak')]
NA It has both excellent and mediocre professors .####[([7], [4], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong'), ([7], [6], [0], 'Negative', 'Weak')]
NA It has some who are very involved in classes while there are other professors who should be barred from entering any school , not just online .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I think , as a student completing my masters in Information Technology , it is not a bad school at all .####[([19], [16], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
NA Can't vouch for the other streams though .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I am currently a student at UoP , and for every post on here there are some truth to them .####[([7], [17, 18], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]

NA I lay down the law .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Period ! ! I am not paying $1300 for a course to have some semi-literate , low self-esteem person affect my grade .####[([19], [15], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
NA UoP has to clean up its act and stop admitting everybody and their grand mama .####[([1], [4, 7], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
NA They have to establish minimum standards and maintain them .####[([1], [5, 6], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]

NA I have had conversations with faculty who have confided their frustrations with the quality of the students .####[([17], [11], [6], 'Negative', 'Average')]
NA Certainly I have been tempted to transfer to a cheaper school with better reputation , but my bills got to be paid plus I keep getting promotion after promotion because I have applied the knowledge I have learned in my current profession .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA So to all the nay sayers..it is not Yale or Columbia...it is UoP and it has a place .####[([13], [8], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
NA UoP is a departure from tradition and people are always scared of change .####[([1], [4, 6], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
NA I embrace change and will use the positive and change the negative .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Over to the Apollo to make the next moves .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA University of Phoenix is a complete waste of time and money .####[([1, 3], [6], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
NA The online experience is like no other !####[([2, 3], [5, 7], [0], 'Neutral', 'Strong')]
NA They misrepresent their programs and then once enrolled , they change midstream .####[([1], [2], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
NA When enrolling for the program I was told that I needed to log into the computer 3 out of 7 days , but once classes started it was 5 out of 7 . This may not sound like a big deal for some , but most people in a MBA distance/online program are there as more of a convienence .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I have found that it is easier to sit in a live class 1 night a week oppossed to being online nearly every day .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Another HUGE turnoff was the group work .####[([6, 7], [2], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
NA Instructors paired the class into teams and assigned papers , projects and power point presentations .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Sounds simple , but when one member of the team does not do their share...everyone suffers !####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I am all for being a team player , but not when it comes to my education .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA Although I take the majority of my classes face to face , ( I hate online classes ) I am completely satisfied ( almost ) with Devry .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I attend the campus in Fort Washington , PA####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I've attended three large traditional universities and have to say that the eduction I'm receiving at Cappella is far superior and much more challenging .####[([13], [19], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
NA On an aside , this type of education is not for the undisciplined learner .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA This College was paid $2 million dollars by Household International , a predatory lender , to add a website that encourages debt among service members , and seems to disregard the Soldiers and Sailors Act which provides temporary relief to active duty service members .####[([2], [28, 30], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
NA Household's parent HSBC is linked to a bank owned by the former-regime of Saddam Hussein .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA The bank relationship is being investigated for money laundering .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA UMUC seems to have disregarded this information , took the $2 million , and turned the other way .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA It is unconscionable that UMUC is supposed to provide higher education to military personnel and , at the same time , is in partnership with a predatory lender that often mishandles payments , records , and disregards the law .####[([5], [3], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
NA UMUC should be blacklisted from US installations and banned from taxayer contracts handed out by the Department of Defense and the US Army , until it ceases its relationship with Household International .####[([1], [4], [0], 'Neutral', 'Weak')]
NA It looks again like UMUC will do anything for money , even profiteering off soldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan .####[([5], [6, 8], [0], 'Neutral', 'Weak')]
NA I go the seattle campus and in the CIS program and agree the that school is expensive .####[([15], [17], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
NA However , for the courses that are critical for my career are hard core .####[([5], [13, 14], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
NA Don't plan on having a life if you are going to school and having a job .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA They have helped a couple friends find jobs and internships . . there are some who hate the school and some who love it . . . as for me , I know I wouldn't get the same education anywhere else####[([19], [17], [15], 'Negative', 'Strong'), ([24], [23], [21], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
NA Capella University was a complete waste of time and money .####[([1, 2], [5], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
NA The only rigorous experiences you can expect are their attempts to drain your pocketbook .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Having attended real universities , prior to paying a huge amount of money to Capella , I was appalled at the lack of academic integrity basically , pay your money and you'll finish .####[([15], [19], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
NA One of the bizarre things you'll notice about Capella and their students is that they refer to themselves as " learners " - that should be almost offensive to anyone who is really concerned with the attainment of a genuinely rigorous educational undertaking : a cat can learn to use a litter box , a rat can learn to use a Skinner box , a dog can learn to drool when a bell has been struck .####[([24], [27], [0], 'Negative', 'Weak'), ([12], [4], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
NA Learning can be a passive activity that also implies there is a finite point at which it stops ( which is what you'll experience at Capella ) .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA A student , on the other hand is one who is actively engaged in the acquisition of new knowledge ; a process that never stops .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA If you want to be a learner who merely connects the dots of poorly written ( and generic ) syllabi created by faculty that really aren't actively engaged in teaching Capella is the choice for you .####[([20], [18], [0], 'Negative', 'Average'), ([20], [14, 15], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
NA Spend your money and get your piece of worthless paper .####[([10], [9], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
NA Capella University is a joke .####[([1, 2], [5], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
NA It's nothing more than a diploma mill that provides a substandard education .####[([1], [2, 4], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong'), ([12], [11], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
NA Instructors ignore students and the administration is simply incompetent .####[([6], [8], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong'), ([1], [2, 3], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]
NA DeVry University is a great investment .####[([1], [5], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
NA The school is going through some transistions as far as their student services is concerned .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA The undergraduate and graduate programs combined last year under the name DeVry University .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA The administration is diligently trying to combine the resources of the school to support both segments of the student body .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I'm a graduate student at the school and the education I get is extremely relevent .####[([10], [14], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
NA I can't overemphasize that enough .####[([4], [2, 5], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
NA The school gives students a knowledge base that makes them extremely competitive in the corporate world .####[([4], [11], [0], 'Positive', 'Strong')]
NA The instructors really do have hands on experience in the areas in which they teach .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I've received valuable advice from many of these real world professionals that I know I couldn't get at a traditional school .####[([4], [3], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
NA The drawbacks of the school is the poor customer service and relaxed admissions standards .####[([14], [12], [0], 'Negative', 'Average'), ([9, 10], [8], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
NA I often have to call multiple times to get a request taken care of .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA The relaxed admissions standards comes from the school being a for-profit school .####[([3, 4], [2], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
NA It often leads to poor group discussions or slackers as group members on group projects .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I'm sure all colleges have their share of slackers so that shouldn't dissuade anybody from attending the school .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA Bottomline , DeVry is an institution that is focused on career development by teaching professional skills for career-oriented students .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA If you absolutely have to have a football team , pep rallies , and all the other mindless activities associated with college , I suggest looking elsewhere .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA In general I have been pleased with UOP instruction and technical support is excellent , but their response times with the newsgroups are often unacceptable .####[([8], [6], [0], 'Positive', 'Average')]
NA UOP needs to put some more money into infrastructure even if it has to take some away from their huge advertising budget .####[([1], [2], [0], 'Neutral', 'Average')]
NA Slow response times or no connectivity at all are becoming much too frequent as they push for more students without sufficiently upgrading infrastructure .####[([15], [16], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
NA I'm not sure I can continue recommending UOP to other students unless they correct these issues .####[([8], [2], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
NA If a CTU recruiter contacts you . . . RUN !####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]

NA Their recruiters make the following promises : we provide the textbooks as a part of the tuition , wonderful instructors , great online interactive learning environment , online library , online resource , but worst of all they tell you that the program is specifically for students that are completely new to programming .####[([20], [19], [2], 'Positive', 'Strong'), ([38], [36, 37], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong'), ([25, 26], [22], [2], 'Positive', 'Strong')]

NA I was really disappointed with the UMUC experience , both face-to-face and online .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA There weren't many upper level F2F courses offered by UMUC in our location .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA UMUC administrators tended to supply larger communities with more choices of F2F courses .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA The equipment used in our courses was often out-of-date , as was the instructor .####[([6], [9], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
NA The course texts were too basic , and for intro level students , I expected something more challenging form the UMUC experience .####[([3], [5], [0], 'Neutral', 'Strong')]
NA There is no student community because UMUC is for career oriented people .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA That means , it's about taking course to get a quick degree to move up the corporate ladder , and going home right after class .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA There isn't much emphasis on literature or art or others soft subjects , so meeting people with those interests is even more difficult .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA It doesn't help that the faculty and administration deliberately spies on students in student groups , plants information in the groups , and seeks to destroy the student groups when the messges get to negative about UMUC .####[([37], [34], [32], 'Negative', 'Strong'), ([6, 8], [24, 26], [0], 'Negative', 'Average'), ([6, 8], [9], [0], 'Negative', 'Strong')]

NA You have to know who to talk to or where to dig for that info , but it's there to be found .####[([0], [0], [0], 'NA', 'NA')]
NA I thought the courses would be more challenging , but because anyone can enroll in a course , the instructors have to dumb it down so everyone can enjoy .####[([4], [7], [0], 'Neutral', 'Strong')]
NA I also don't like the fact that UMUC assigns instructors across multiple fiel;ds , outisde their departments to teach courses .####[([8], [3], [0], 'Negative', 'Average')]
