I charge it at night and skip taking the cord with me because of the good battery life .####[([9], 'NEU'), ([16, 17], 'POS')]
I bought a HP Pavilion DV4-1222nr laptop and have had so many problems with the computer .####[]
The tech guy then said the service center does not do 1-to-1 exchange and I have to direct my concern to the "sales" team , which is the retail shop which I bought my netbook from .####[([1, 2], 'NEU'), ([6, 7], 'NEG'), ([22, 23], 'NEG')]
I investigated netbooks and saw the Toshiba NB305-N410BL .####[]
it is of high quality , has a killer GUI , is extremely stable , is highly expandable , is bundled with lots of very good applications , is easy to use , and is absolutely gorgeous .####[([4], 'POS'), ([9], 'POS'), ([26], 'POS'), ([31], 'POS')]
Easy to start up and does not overheat as much as other laptops .####[([2, 3], 'POS')]
Sad very SAD .####[]
I even got my teenage son one , because of the features that it offers , like , iChat , Photobooth , garage band and more !####[([11], 'POS'), ([18], 'POS'), ([20], 'POS'), ([22, 23], 'POS')]
Needless to say a PC that ca n't support a cell phone is less than useless !####[]
Great laptop that offers many great features !####[([6], 'POS')]
they have done absolutely nothing to fix the computer problem .####[]
One night I turned the freaking thing off after using it , the next day I turn it on , no GUI , screen all dark , power light steady , hard drive light steady and not flashing as it usually does .####[([21], 'NEG'), ([23], 'NEG'), ([27, 28], 'NEU'), ([31, 32, 33], 'NEG')]
Still pretty pricey , but I 've been putting off money for a while as a little Macbook Fund , and finally got to use it .####[]
In the shop , these MacBooks are encased in a soft rubber enclosure , so you will never know about the razor edge until you buy it , get it home , break the seal and use it very clever con .####[([11, 12], 'POS'), ([22], 'NEG')]
However , the multi-touch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary unless you 're gaming .####[([3, 4], 'POS'), ([7, 8], 'POS'), ([12, 13], 'NEU'), ([18], 'NEU')]
Plus it is small and reasonably light so I can take it with me to and from work .####[]
I HATE this one .####[]
They were totally unconcerned that the computer was not correctly repaired in the first place .####[]
The speed is incredible and I am more than satisfied .####[([1], 'POS')]
on the bright side at least I was n't without my laptop for long this time !####[]
This laptop meets every expectation and Windows 7 is great !####[([6, 7], 'POS')]
That 's how frustrating it was .####[]
I can barely use any usb devices because they will not stay connected properly .####[([5, 6], 'NEG')]
The one down side to it is that when I play a certin game on here , it tends to freeze up sometimes , but thats the only bad thing about this computer .####[]
-No backlit keyboard , but not an issue for me .####[]
When I finally had everything running with all my software installed I plugged in my droid to recharge and the system crashed .####[([9], 'NEU'), ([20], 'NEG')]
I ca n't even turn it off .####[]
One suggestion I do have , is to not bother getting Microsoft office for the mac expecting it will work just like you knew it to on a PC .####[([11, 12, 13, 14, 15], 'NEG')]
I also got the added bonus of a 30" HD Monitor , which really helps to extend my screen and keep my eyes fresh !####[([8, 9, 10], 'POS'), ([18], 'NEU')]
Would do business again .####[]
The machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely .####[([5, 6], 'NEG')]
After paying several hundred dollars for this service , it is frustrating that you can not get help after hours .####[([7], 'NEG')]
I have had the luxury sarcasm of owning 2 of these laptops .####[]
What a waste .####[]
It was a total Dhell experience that I will never repeat .####[]
There are a few flaws as well that I noticed .####[]
Completely worth every single penny dime and nickel .####[]
I tried to upgrade it to a newer version a couple of months ago and I still have the same problem .####[]
I did have to replace the battery once , but that was only a couple months ago and it 's been working perfect ever since .####[]
, In the past four years I 've had it I have never once gotten a virus .####[]
I love the operating system and the preloaded software .####[([3, 4], 'POS'), ([7, 8], 'POS')]
They were great in handling this problem , and I 'm looking forward in purchasing additonal products from them in the future .####[]
I 've tried going back to XL but there still problems .####[]
The best thing about this laptop is the price along with some of the newer features .####[([8], 'POS'), ([15], 'POS')]
After numerous attempts of trying including setting the clock in BIOS setup directly , I gave upI am a techie .####[([8, 9, 10, 11], 'NEG')]
YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TALK TO AN AMERICAN WARRANTY SERVICE IS OUT OF COUNTRY .####[([10, 11], 'NEG')]
But it may be potentially hundreds or thousands in the near future .####[]
but now i have realized its a problem with this brand .####[([10], 'NEG')]
It can not save the correct date and time I set .####[]
And this is n't just my one experine .####[]
I was looking for a mac which is portable and has all the features that I was looking for .####[([13], 'POS')]
I would highly recommend this one to my friends####[]
I honestly love my mac , thats why I am a self proclaimed mac addict .####[]
And these are some reasons you should get a macbook pro .####[]
Also kinda loud when the fan was running .####[([5], 'NEG')]
I purchased this laptop while on a business trip to keep up with my email .####[]
There also seemed to be a problem with the hard disc as certain times windows loads but claims to not be able to find any drivers or files .####[([9, 10], 'NEG'), ([14], 'NEG'), ([25], 'NEU')]
Drivers updated ok but the BIOS update froze the system up and the computer shut down .####[([0], 'POS'), ([5, 6], 'NEG'), ([9], 'NEG')]
-they lost my laptop for a month####[]
Spent 2 hours on phone with HP Technical Support .####[([6, 7, 8], 'NEU')]
This is my second laptop , and it is head and shoulders above my first .####[]
at first !####[]
Speaking of the browser , it too has problems .####[([3], 'NEG')]
I think just going from PC to Mac has gotten me totally spoiled and I ca n't imagine ever going back .####[]
The keyboard is too slick .####[([1], 'NEG')]
Nightly my computer defrags itself and runs a virus scan .####[([8, 9], 'NEU')]
It 's like 9 punds , but if you can look past it , it 's GREAT !####[([3, 4], 'NEG')]
It 's just as fast with one program open as it is with sixteen open .####[([7], 'NEU')]
Still under warrenty so called Toshiba , no help at all .####[([2], 'NEG')]
I was happy with My purchase of a Toshiba Satellite L305D-S5934 laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the Toshiba Warranty .####[([22, 23], 'NEG')]
I LOVE IT !####[]
The fact that you can spend over $ 100 on just a webcam underscores the value of this machine .####[([12], 'NEU'), ([15], 'POS')]
I mainly use it for email , internet , and managing personal files pics , vids , etc .####[([7], 'NEU'), ([10, 11, 12], 'NEU')]
A month or so ago , the freaking motherboard just died .####[([8], 'NEG')]
The system it comes with does not work properly , so when trying to fix the problems with it it started not working at all .####[([1], 'NEG')]
Then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so I was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running .####[([7], 'NEG'), ([20], 'NEG')]
I took it back to Best Buy where they were so helpful and immediately gave me a new one .####[]
If you had PC for four years I can almost gaurentee that something would of gone wrong by now , maybe even forcing you to replace your entire computer .####[]
*2 weeks after giving the computer for repair*-Called headquarters , they report that they have not looked at it yet but it is on the top of the stack .####[]
This machine delivers .####[]
Then 2 of my nephews were going into music and both fell in love with the MacBook Pro .####[]
I complain again .####[]
This laptop is insane ! ! !####[]
If a website ever freezes which is rare , its really easy to force quit .####[([13, 14], 'POS')]
It rarely works and when it does it 's incredibly slow .####[([2], 'NEG')]
I also enjoy the fact that my MacBook Pro laptop allows me to run Windows 7 on it by using the VMWare program .####[([14, 15], 'POS'), ([21, 22], 'NEU')]
It 's so much easier to navigate through the operating system , to find files , and it runs a lot faster !####[([6], 'POS'), ([9, 10], 'POS'), ([13, 14], 'POS'), ([18], 'POS')]
Purchased a Toshiba Lap top it worked good until just after the warrenty went out .####[([12], 'NEG')]
I always swore by PCs and would never consider a MAC .####[]
This is now my 3rd MacBook Pro and I really honestly love it !####[]
for 2 months .####[]
I wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused , because they knew it was trouble .####[([5, 6], 'NEU')]
It 's not like I have used for half a year and then complained about it .####[]
Still trying to learn how to use it .####[]
The reality was , it heated up very quickly , and took way too long to do simple things , like opening my Documents folder .####[([21, 22, 23, 24], 'NEG')]
I bought the netbook because it was smaller and lighter for me to carry around .####[]
We 'll save our money to replace it with a Mac again !####[]
Thank you for your great product !####[]
this company truely does make horrible products and doesnt seem to because they are certain things like this never happen .####[]
I had always used PCs and been constantly frustrated by the crashing and the poorly designed operating systems that were never very intuitive .####[([16, 17], 'NEG')]
Sorry Toshiba , but 1st impressions do count for something .####[]
Then , within 5 months , the charger crapped out on me .####[([7], 'NEG')]
And if you have a iphone or ipod touch you can connect and download songs to it at high speed .####[([19], 'POS')]
Overall this laptop is great .####[]
I love the glass touchpad .####[([3, 4], 'POS')]
I continued to take the computer in AGAIN and they replaced the hard drive and mother board yet again .####[([12, 13], 'NEG'), ([15, 16], 'NEG')]
I am using the external speaker sound is good .####[([4, 5, 6], 'POS')]
Ok , this is probably the best laptop series ever devised by Apple .####[]
As of a couple weeks ago the middle portion of the laptop from top to bottom , , , about 4 inches across is hardly visible .####[]
still testing the battery life as i thought it would be better , but am very happy with the upgrade .####[([3, 4], 'NEG')]
Then HP sends it back to me with the hardware screwed up , not able to connect .####[([9], 'NEG')]
I just hope the reputation that Toshiba has is true and I wo n't have to worry about a crash .####[]
Oh yeah , do n't forget the expensive shipping to and from HP .####[([8], 'NEG')]
I would recommend anyone to buy from pcconnection express .####[]
Good luck .####[]
Everything is so easy to use , Mac software is just so much simpler than Microsoft software .####[([5], 'POS'), ([7, 8], 'POS'), ([15, 16], 'NEG')]
My favorite by far , although the most expensive , was my Sony .####[]
And if you do a lot of writing , editing is a problem since there is no forward delete key .####[([9], 'NEG'), ([18, 19], 'NEG')]
Also I typed faster then then letters would show and it got to be realy annoying .####[]
As an owner of a Toshiba Satalite laptop computer things you should know before you buy .####[]
Its ease of use and the top service from Apple be it their phone assistance or bellying up to the genius bar can not be beat .####[([3], 'POS'), ([7], 'POS'), ([13, 14], 'POS'), ([20, 21], 'POS')]
It has a 10 hour battery life when you 're doing web browsing and word editing , making it perfect for the classroom or office , and in terms of gaming and movie playing it 'll have a battery life of just over 5 hours .####[([5, 6], 'POS'), ([11, 12], 'NEU'), ([14, 15], 'NEU'), ([30], 'NEU'), ([32, 33], 'NEU'), ([38, 39], 'POS')]
I shipped out on Saturday , July 17 .####[]
I bought it for really cheap also and it 's AMAZING .####[]
Acer has set me up with FREE recovery discs , when they are available since I asked .####[([7, 8], 'POS')]
I also purchased Office Max's "Max Assurance" with the no lemon clause .####[([3, 4, 5, 6], 'NEU')]
I eventually did the migration from my iMac backup disc which uses USB .####[([7, 8, 9], 'NEU'), ([12], 'NEU')]
-They say it will take up to two weeks .####[]
I did n't like one thing about it .####[]
The battery life seems to be very good , and have had no issues with it .####[([1, 2], 'POS')]
Enabling the battery timer is useless .####[([2, 3], 'NEG')]
Temperatures on the outside were alright but i did not track in Core Processing Unit temperatures .####[([0], 'NEU'), ([12, 13, 14, 15], 'NEU')]
Yeah , to you .####[]
I got a mac as my HS graduation gift .####[]
It turned out it 's not really a problem to have a Mac .####[]
Page just disapeared after you got yahoo or downloaded something .####[]
Images can be multi-selected and viewed swiftly or in slideshow mode .####[]
Going to bring it to service today .####[([5], 'NEU')]
There is no need to purchase virus protection for Mac , which saves me a lot of time and money .####[([6, 7, 8, 9], 'POS')]
But we had paid for bluetooth , and there was none .####[([5], 'NEG')]
So , I paid a visit to LG notebook service center at Alexandra Road , hoping they can make the hinge tighter .####[([7, 8, 9, 10], 'NEU'), ([20], 'NEG')]
My daughter uses it for games , email , facebook , pictures and music .####[([5], 'NEU')]
Laptop is to be used like a Netbook .####[]
It is always reliable , never bugged and responds well .####[([8], 'POS')]
After about a week I finally got it back and was told that the motherboard had failed and so they installed a new motherboard .####[([14], 'NEG'), ([23], 'NEG')]
It was slow , locked up , and also had hardware replaced after only 2 months !####[([10], 'NEG')]
they had to replace the motherboard in April####[([5], 'NEG')]
Yes , the computer was light weight , less expensive than the average laptop , and was pretty self explantory in use .####[([21], 'POS')]
Also , if you need to talk to a representive at Microsoft , there is a charge , which I believe is robbery , since you are charged enormous amounts for a very badly designed system , which most people would have went with XP if they could .####[([9, 10, 11], 'NEG'), ([35], 'NEG'), ([44], 'POS')]
There is a little indent to help open it , but good luck with that .####[]
I love WIndows 7 which is a vast improvment over Vista .####[([2, 3], 'POS'), ([10], 'NEG')]
Also , I have alot of trouble with it getting very hot , and not even sitting on anything to make it hot .####[]
It Was a great deal after all .####[]
This mac is great !####[]
Keyboard is great , very quiet for all the typing that I do .####[([0], 'POS')]
I grew up in a design family so it only made sense .####[]
Gave phonenumber .####[]
Oh my goodness-I am not a happy camper .####[]
Dell's customer disservice is an insult to it 's customers who pay good money for shoddy products .####[([0, 1, 2], 'NEG')]
I 'd recommend this laptop to anyone !####[]
Yet , HP wo n't do anything about the problem .####[]
It had a cooling system malfunction after 10 minutes of general use , and would not move past this error .####[([3, 4], 'NEG'), ([11], 'NEU')]
I can render AVCHD movies with little effort , which was a problem for most pc 's unless you had a quad core I7 .####[([21, 22, 23], 'POS')]
It 's a bummer and one out of five is being kind .####[]
This is what they told me , It heats up , and that is the reason we no longer call them laptops , and simply categorize them as portables .####[]
After talking it over with the very knowledgeable sales associate , I chose the MacBook Pro over the white MacBook .####[([8, 9], 'POS')]
If you really want a bang-up system and do n't need to run Windows applications , go with an Apple ;####[([6], 'POS'), ([13, 14], 'NEU')]
You wo n't have to spend gobs of money on some inefficient virus program that needs to be updated every month and that constantly drains your wallet .####[([12, 13], 'NEG')]
This laptop is fast and you will literally learn all you can do with this dynamo by just watching the online tutorials .####[]
One of them seems to have worked .####[]
Which I still use and have hooked up to my TV .####[]
The problem I had with this unit was unresolvable .####[]
2 months later , the battery went .####[([5], 'NEG')]
You may need to special order a bag .####[([7], 'NEU')]
It 's color is even cool .####[([2], 'POS')]

I would recommend anyone to buy from pcconnection express .####[]
Yes , a Mac is much more money than the average laptop out there , but there is no comparison in style , speed and just cool factor .####[([21], 'POS'), ([23], 'POS')]
He gave me this PC about 3 years ago and up to this point im still sitting here using it .####[]
I 'm pleased .####[]
The keyboard feels good and I type just fine on it .####[([1], 'POS')]
Shiny This Laptop is the Best of the best !####[]
I thought the white Mac computers looked dirty too quicly where you use the mousepad and where you place your hands when typing .####[([14], 'NEU')]
Do n't waste their money , save it and but a mac .####[]
Money and time well spent !####[]
Gradually the freezing screen evolved into a screen that froze in weird shapes .####[]

I like the laptop overall .####[]
I now travel with this laptop and my work PC .####[]
I am however pleased that it is still hanging in there .####[]
Both my husband and I have this model Toshiba .####[]
no complaints with their desktop , and maybe because it just sits on your desktop , and you do n't carry it around , which could jar the hard drive , or the motherboard .####[([28, 29], 'NEU'), ([33], 'NEU')]
Yes , they cost more , but they more than make up for it in speed , construction quality , and longevity .####[([15], 'POS'), ([17, 18], 'POS'), ([21], 'POS')]
Since I keyboard over 100 wpm , I look for a unit that has a comfortble keyboard no keys sticking or lagging , strange configuration of "extra key" , etc .####[([2], 'POS'), ([16], 'POS'), ([18], 'POS'), ([24, 25, 26, 27], 'POS')]
I also tried the touch pad and compared it to other netbooks in the store .####[([4, 5], 'NEU')]
It gets stuck all of the time you use it , and you have to keep tapping on it to get it to work .####[([8], 'NEG'), ([23], 'NEG')]

My favorite part of this computer is that it has a vga port so I can connect it to a bigger screen .####[([11, 12], 'POS'), ([21], 'NEU')]
Another thing I might add is the battery life is excellent .####[([7, 8], 'POS')]
One drawback , I wish the keys were backlit .####[([6], 'NEG')]
When the buyer returned it Wal Mart just boxed it , taped it shut resold it as new .####[]
What a great little laptop .####[]
Acer was no help and Garmin could not determine the problemafter spending about 2 hours with me , so I returned it and purchased a Toshiba R700 that seems even nicer and I was able to load all of my software with no problem .####[([40], 'POS')]
I play a lot of casual games online , and the touchpad is very responsive .####[([11], 'POS')]
Granted , it 's still a very new laptop but in comparison to my previous laptops and desktops , my Mac boots up noticeably quicker .####[([21, 22], 'POS')]
It caught a virus that completely wiped out my hard drive in a matter of hours .####[([9, 10], 'NEG')]
WOULD PAY MORE FOR IT IF I HAD TOO !####[]
Could n't keep a page up you were working on !####[]
It is everything I 'd hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint , but somehow a bit more sturdy .####[([11, 12, 13, 14], 'POS')]
The Bluetooth was not there at all , and the fingerprint reader driver would be there , but the software would hang after installation was 1/2 way done .####[([1], 'NEG'), ([10, 11, 12], 'NEG'), ([19], 'NEG')]
I would not recommend this product to anyone .####[]
I like to use it at the race track to handiecap the horse races .####[]
I was given a Mac as a birthday present and could n't be happier with it 3 years later .####[]
The delivery was fast , and I would not hesitate to purchase this laptop again .####[([1], 'POS')]
I 've been impressed with the battery life and the performance for such a small amount of memory .####[([6, 7], 'POS'), ([10], 'POS'), ([17], 'NEG')]

I 'm extremely happy with my purchase as I now have the portable power I have been looking for .####[]

I got it back and my built-in webcam and built-in mic were shorting out anytime I touched the lid , mind you this was my means of communication with my fiance who was deployed but I suffered thru it and would constandly have to reset the computer to be able to use my cam and mic anytime they went out .####[([6, 7], 'NEG'), ([9, 10], 'NEG'), ([53], 'NEG'), ([55], 'NEG')]
Is this partially due to the fact that it is running Windows Vista ?####[([11, 12], 'NEU')]
You might think , I am new in this game , but I am a gadget lover , and have had more than 2 dozens laptops in the past 15 years , and none gets this hot , that fast .####[]

This computer was awful , I would never recomend it to another person .####[]
The service tech said he had tried to duplicate the damage and was n't able to recreate it therefore it had to be their defect .####[([1, 2], 'NEG')]

One of the primary reasons why I purchased an IPad was to store photographs so that I could show to my customers .####[]
Runs Hot I thought we were paying for quality in our decision to buy an Apple product .####[([8], 'NEG')]
For the not so good , I got the stock screen , which is VERY glossy .####[([9, 10], 'NEG')]
The gray color was a good choice .####[([1, 2], 'POS')]
This was the second computer and brand bought that day .####[]
VERY disappointing ,####[]
I love this product because it is Toshiba and its 156 .####[]
I would like to have volume buttons rather than the adjustment that is on the front .####[([5, 6], 'NEG')]
This is my first computer purchase####[]
People know what they are talking about and they have pride in the product that they are selling .####[]
Would HIGHLY recommend this netbook though .####[]

I decided I wanted a laptop so I went into the BBY store .####[]
I like how the Mac OS is so simple and easy to use .####[([4, 5], 'POS'), ([12], 'POS')]

In the three years I 've had my MacBook Pro , I have never had a virus on my computer , and I do a lot of work on the internet .####[]
I was ready to take it back for a refund , but the Geek Squad camed through and pointed me in the right direction to get it fixed .####[([13, 14], 'POS')]
I have had laptops in the past and I thought why not give these small netbooks a try .####[]
It ca n't get any better .####[]
All the problems I have had with PC 's are solved with a Mac , the issue of overheating-my Dell was always overheating and not working properly or simply shutting off , and the issue of viruses and contaminants-my HP completely quit working within2 years of purchasing it , with no inexpensive way of fixing it .####[]
only good thing is the graphics quality .####[([5, 6], 'POS')]
The other lock-up problems are from a myriad of causes , the most common being a corrupted version of Appleworks which can render the browser useless .####[([19], 'NEG'), ([24], 'NEG')]
In short I would never buy a Compaq again .####[]
The paint wears off easily due to the keyboard being farther back than usual .####[([1], 'NEG'), ([8], 'NEG')]
That 's right , no power , absolutely NOTHING .####[]
I had purchased it from a major electronics store and took it to their service department to find out what the problem was .####[([14, 15], 'NEU')]
The store honored their warrenty and made the comment that they do n't even recommend the HP brand because of the problems with their warrenty .####[([4], 'POS'), ([24], 'POS')]
But I was wrong .####[]
NO good .####[]
I always use a backup hard disk to store important files at all times .####[([5, 6], 'NEU')]
But the screen size is not that bad for email and web browsing .####[([2, 3], 'POS'), ([11, 12], 'NEU')]
Once I removed all the software the laptop loads in 15-20 seconds .####[([5], 'NEG'), ([8], 'NEU')]

Am very glad I bought it , great netbook , low price .####[([11], 'POS')]
Obviously , this Macbook is P-E-R-F-E-C-T for me because it does exactly what I need in an easy-to-function way .####[]
Worth the investment and truly a fine piece of equipment .####[]
The Apple team also assists you very nicely when choosing which computer is right for you ,####[([1, 2], 'POS')]
The video chat is the only thing that is iffy about it but im sure once they unpdate the next version on the macbook book the quality of it will be better .####[([1, 2], 'NEG')]
You 'll need to upgrade and pay a little more for them .####[]
it is hard to fix and makes it a hassle to own one .####[]
Macs are designed for the frontal lobe challenged people out there .####[]
Fan vents to the side , so no cooling pad needed , great feature !####[([0], 'POS'), ([8, 9], 'NEU'), ([13], 'POS')]
i use my mac all the time , i love the software , the way it takes a short time to load things , how easy it is to use and most of all how you do n't have to worry about viruses .####[([11], 'POS')]
Wasted me at least 8 hours of installation time .####[([7, 8], 'NEG')]
It has far exceeded my expectations for power , storage , and abilitiy .####[([7], 'POS'), ([9], 'POS'), ([12], 'POS')]
A great feature is the spotlight search , one can search for documents by simply typing a keyword , rather than parsing tens of file folders for a document .####[([2], 'POS'), ([5, 6], 'POS')]
My wireless system would not recognize Windows 7 and I could n't get online to find out why .####[([1, 2], 'NEG'), ([6, 7], 'NEU')]

It is the worst laptop ever####[]
Suffice it to say , my MacBook Pro keeps me going with its long battery life and blazing speed .####[([14, 15], 'POS'), ([18], 'POS')]
I 'm not going to lie , I 've never really liked the Acer brand in general .####[]
The OS is also very user friendly , even for those that switch from a PC , with a little practice you can take full advantage of this OS !####[([1], 'POS'), ([28], 'POS')]
iTunes is a handy music-management program , and it is essential for anyone with an iPod .####[([0], 'POS'), ([5], 'POS')]
Would buy 100 more of these if I could .####[]
while it was barely a bargin in the begining , i would never purchase another dell and would not recomend the dell brand to others .####[]
Great product .####[]
Mac is not made for gaming .####[([5], 'NEG')]
Well I spilled something on it and they replaced it with this model , which gets hot and the battery does n't make it through 1 DVD .####[([19], 'NEG')]
I 've had to call Apple support to set up my new printer and have had wonderful experiences with helpful , english speaking from Vancouver techs that walked me through the processes to help me .####[([5, 6], 'POS'), ([25], 'POS')]
But Sony said we could send it back and be charged for adding the bluetooth an additional seventy something dollars .####[([12, 13, 14], 'NEG')]
By this time I was regretting ever SEEING this machine on the shelf !####[]
Toshiba is a great brand , even though I have n't had it for a long time , I am very happy with it !####[]
I need graphic power to run my Adobe Creative apps efficiently .####[([2, 3], 'NEU'), ([7, 8, 9], 'NEU')]
the programs are esay to use and are quick to process this computer works like a charm .####[([1], 'POS'), ([5], 'POS')]
The materials that came with the computer did not include the right # anywhere .####[([1], 'NEG')]
So when you do call to complain about the hunk of metal you get the joy of speaking with a bunch of people you ca n't understand .####[]
That day !####[]
For one , I noticed that from turning on my mac to logging on only took about 25 seconds .####[]
It does not even have the software to play a dvd now .####[([6], 'NEG')]
My brother is a computer wiz and would laugh at me because he used an Apple .####[]
Since I never really got to use this , I ca n't comment on anything except what went wrong after trying 2 of them .####[]
Buyers beware .####[]
HOW DOES THE POWER SUPPLY NOT WORK ! ! !####[([3, 4], 'NEG')]

Love it .####[]
I reloaded with Windows 7 Ultimate , and the Bluetooth and Fingerprint reader software would not load .####[([3, 4, 5], 'NEG'), ([9], 'NEG'), ([11, 12, 13], 'NEG')]

Oh , it is such a great piece of equipment .####[]
this is my second one and the same problem , bad video card unreliable overall , this will be my second time returning this laptop back to best buy .####[([11, 12], 'NEG')]

I recommend for word processing and internet users .####[([3, 4], 'POS'), ([6], 'POS')]
Since I 've had this computer I 've only used the trackpad because it is so nice and smooth .####[([11], 'POS')]
When the computer has been on for several minutes , it will occasionaly just go off by itself .####[]
A longer battery life would have been great , but it meets it 's spec quite easily .####[([14], 'POS')]
Who could n't love a DVD burner , 80-gigabyte HD , and fairly new graphics chip ? As I soon discovered , though , there is a reason for which similarly-configured Sony and Toshiba machines cost more , they use higher-quality components that are faster , better-configured , and end up lasting a lot longer .####[([5, 6], 'POS'), ([9], 'POS'), ([14, 15], 'POS'), ([41], 'POS')]
falls into the case .####[]
This is something i would deffinately reccomend to someone .####[]
Its fast and another thing I like is that it has three USB ports .####[([12, 13], 'POS')]
Mac computers automatically defrag each time you start your computer .####[]

That system is fixed .####[([1], 'NEU')]
The computer itself was fast , ran smoothly , and had no problems .####[([6], 'POS')]
One of the smartest thing I did was take my time to compare laptops before making my purchase .####[]
Like the price and operation .####[([2], 'POS'), ([4], 'POS')]
The brand is tarnished in my heart .####[([1], 'NEG')]
This is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components , and I 'm hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator , but I still expected better product quality for this price range .####[([11], 'NEG'), ([24, 25, 26], 'NEU'), ([34], 'NEG'), ([37, 38], 'NEG')]
Honestly , this is absolutely wonderful .####[]
I have had it for about a 1 1/2 and yes I have had an issue with it one month out of warranty .####[([22], 'NEU')]
I really wish I had done this years ago .####[]
For example , when my husband turns the light out while I 'm on the computer .####[]
Once open , the leading edge is razor sharp .####[([4, 5], 'NEG')]
Loaded with bloatware .####[([2], 'NEU')]
If you buy , pray you do n't have major prolems .####[]
Do n't get me wrong , I am no Microsoft hater , I 've just managed to turn into a much bigger Apple fan because of this machine .####[]
HP refused to give me a new one and Wal Mart refused to take it back .####[]

I would easly reccomend this laptop to a friend .####[]
I spent alot of money on this product and its been a nightmare .####[]
I also like the acer arcade but these were reallythe only two things I liked about this laptop .####[([4, 5], 'POS')]

Love it so far .####[]
It is so much easier to use####[([6], 'POS')]

It is so nice not to worry about that and the extra expense that comes along with the necessary virus protection on PC 's .####[([19, 20], 'POS')]
The Notebook PC , Toshiba Qosmio is the best gift my father could have ever gotten me .####[]

Other than that I do n't have one complaint in the world !####[]
The computer is so slow , even after paying staples the extra money to speed it up .####[]
I feel that enough people have Macs these days and that companies need to start making things more compatable than they used to be .####[]
The price premium is a little much , but when you start looking at the features it is worth the added cash .####[([1, 2], 'NEG'), ([15], 'POS')]

There are several programs for Garageband Pages , Garageband , Garageband , etc , music Garageband , photo management Photo Booth , iPhoto , video-editing or movie-making iMovie , etc .####[([3], 'NEU'), ([5, 6], 'NEU'), ([8], 'NEU'), ([10], 'NEU'), ([14, 15], 'NEU'), ([17, 18, 19, 20], 'NEU'), ([22], 'NEU'), ([24], 'NEU'), ([26, 27], 'NEU')]
This is my 3rd Apple Laptop and first MacBook Pro .####[]
I have had this laptop for a few months now and i would say im pretty satisfied .####[]
The love part of my relationship with this laptop does n't take very long .####[]
Not enough time for me to give it 5 stars !####[]
The screen shows great colors .####[([1], 'POS'), ([4], 'POS')]
That 's a huge difference .####[]
Dells are ok , HPs are n't that good , but Macs or Fantastic .####[]
I am totally satisfied with my little toshie !####[]
I have no idea how to burn cd's or to use the web cam , just for starters .####[([6, 7], 'NEU'), ([12, 13], 'NEU')]
Again , I sent it off to Acer , by this time they were paying for me to send it to them and everything , but it was still inconvienent because of my classes and my communication with my fiance .####[]
DEFINITELY recommended ! ! !####[]
It is extremely user friendly and intuitive .####[]
Let me start with the good , So awesome .####[]
I had finally reached my limit and broke down .####[]
The 17 inch screen is very large , but the computer is very light .####[([1, 2, 3], 'NEG')]
My opinion of Sony has been dropping as fast as the stock market , given their horrible support , but this machine just caused another plunge .####[([17], 'NEG')]
For the Bluetooth to work properly , you must install the Launch Manager on the Drivers/Applications DVD , or it will not show after the reload .####[([2], 'NEU'), ([11, 12], 'NEU'), ([15, 16], 'NEU')]
I waited and waited and no laptop .####[]
Everything is falling apart internally and externally .####[]
I also liked the glass screen .####[([4, 5], 'POS')]
The switchable graphic card is pretty sweet when you want gaming on the laptop .####[([1, 2, 3], 'POS'), ([10], 'NEU')]
It super shiny , so you can see the fingerprints easily .####[]
It 's not a wear-and-tear issue , not due to user carelessness and most importantly , they CA N'T guarantee the problem will be solved if it is sent for service and I have to accept the outcome .####[([30], 'NEG')]
The battery life has not decreased since I bought it , so i 'm thrilled with that .####[([1, 2], 'POS')]
When I called Toshiba , they would not do anything and even tried to charge me $ 35 for the phone call , even though they did n't offer any technical support .####[([30, 31], 'NEG')]
I bought this notebook and only had it for 3 months If it is overload with updates the BOOT MGR .####[([18, 19], 'NEU')]
Oh and if thats not bad enough it does n't come with a recovery cd so you can make one if you know how to or buy one if you buy it the cost is $ 25 for two cds .####[([13, 14], 'NEG')]
The price and features more than met my needs .####[([1], 'POS'), ([3], 'POS')]
They refuse .####[]
big mistake !####[]
and dell and best buy both refused to take it back after i only had it for 1 hour .####[]
My friends or children use that when they need to borrow the Net = When I out grow this Meaning when its old and my oldest child is ready for one she will get this one ANd I will be buying only TOSHIBA !####[]
First of all , I 've been Dell fan for more than fifteen years .####[]
GREAT INVESTMENT !####[]
I am just amazed .####[]
I burned my leg , after lifting it from my desk , and for less than 5 second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table , so I can place it there .####[]
I thought all my problems would finally be solved being that my old computer would n't go onto our wireless network and I would n't have the same problems because it was updated .####[]
Skype is just so dang cool with this machine too .####[([0], 'POS')]
I would buy this lap top over and over again !####[]
the mouse buttons are hard to push .####[([1, 2], 'NEG')]
Also , HDD secures inside using rails , and there is only one set on the main hard drive .####[([2], 'POS'), ([6], 'NEU'), ([17, 18], 'NEU')]
If you 're not wanting to be mobile , this is a good laptop to sit on a desk .####[]
I also travel with it and it never gives me any problems .####[]
Just do n't waste your time and money on this .####[]
All I will say now is that it was over two grand less expensive and so much better quality than my hunk of crap Vaio .####[([18], 'POS')]
Beware , their staff could send you back making you feel that only they know what a computer is .####[([3], 'NEG')]
No problems , no lock ups , no disappointments .####[]
I am definitely sold , and not going back to PCs for home use !####[]
I have a lapdesk which I can use , but I can still feel the heat through the foam and plastic .####[]
and its really cheap and you wont regret buying it .####[]
It was over rated !####[]
I do n't understand how anyone can think this is a great product worth purchasing .####[]
My sister has the same Mac as me and she is in a band and uses GarageBand to record and edit .####[([16], 'NEU')]
I was n't really sure I wanted to spend that kind of money !####[]
Other Thoughts , Do not purchase this product .####[]
They say that this will invalidate the warranty on the hard drive I do n't really understand why but anyway .####[([7], 'NEG'), ([10, 11], 'NEU')]
and looks very sexyy , D really the mac book pro is the best laptop specially for students in college if you are not caring about price .####[([26], 'NEG')]
I took the computer back in yet again except this time they kept it to send into their Geek Squad headquarters .####[]
This is a great laptop and I would recommend it to anyone .####[]
They definitely have a superior product !####[]
A great computer for light home use and business use .####[([5, 6], 'POS'), ([8, 9], 'POS')]
Bought it to use mostly for oline classes .####[]
Also consider the MS Office apps are all trial versions , hope you have your own copies .####[([3, 4, 5], 'NEG')]
They are wonderful , but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat .####[]
This computer was awful !####[]
Heck , if I had enough money , I would but it as a gift for someone .####[]
The battery life is amazingly long at 7hrs and 5hrs if you use it .####[([1, 2], 'POS')]
My previous purchases were with Dell and HP .####[]
I have not have any problems .####[]
I purchased an HP right after my high school graduation .####[]
Me and my boyfriend bought the Gateway NV78 in nov of 09 .####[]
It is very user friendly and not hard to figure out at all .####[]
lightweight , long battery life , excellent transition from PC ;####[([3, 4], 'POS')]
The price is another driving influence that made me purchase this laptop .####[([1], 'POS')]
The Nortons virus scan is only for a very short time unlike others that usually are good for a year .####[([1, 2, 3], 'NEG')]
It is stamped and not in pieces therefore it is a stronger more resilient frame .####[([14], 'POS')]
I am first time Mac Buyer and am amazed at features and ease of use the Mac offers .####[([10], 'POS'), ([14], 'POS')]
Two , owning a 17 inmac book gives the flexibility to sit anywhere you want without worry about bother anyone .####[]
Sent unit back and it 's been two months .####[]
Came fully loaded , good .####[([2], 'POS')]
I noticed windows has a new system called Windows 7 , what about us Vista users ? They should get all the bugs out of Vista before investing in a new system .####[([2], 'NEU'), ([8, 9], 'NEU'), ([14], 'NEU'), ([25], 'NEU')]
When we bought our new HP comouter in Dec of 2008 , we wanted Windows XP , but were told it would cost an extra $ 159 , so we went with Vista .####[([32], 'NEU')]
I definatly ca n't .####[]
Files as well would become lost , deleted or corrupted .####[]
It is meant to be PORTABLE .####[]
My laptop worked again for just a while before I started having issues AGAIN .####[]
This is perfect for her field .####[]
taking it back less than 24 hours of purchase####[]
The only thing that I have , is the key broad is a little dark to see the letters , would help if it was a little lighter then it is .####[([9, 10], 'NEG')]
Hopefully Amazon will take this back .####[]
They ended up keeping my computer for almost 3 months !####[]
I 'm still within the one year warranty but the repair "depot" has deemed that this time it was caused by physical abuse and is not covered .####[([7], 'NEG'), ([10, 11], 'NEG')]
But I needed a laptop for school use .####[([6, 7], 'NEU')]
he ca n't stand it .####[]
The computer was delivered as promised .####[]
This is the complete opposite to an ergonomic design .####[([8], 'NEG')]
I would like at least a 4 hr battery life .####[([8, 9], 'NEU')]
The only thing that I do n't like about my mac is that sometimes there are programs that I want to be able to run and I am not able to .####[([16], 'NEG')]
Looking online , many people are having the same problem .####[]
Wireless has not been a issue for me , like some others have meantioned .####[([0], 'POS')]
THIS IS MY SECOND MAC BOOK PRO .####[]
MacBook Notebooks quickly die out because of their short battery life , as well as the many background programs that run without the user 's knowlede .####[([9, 10], 'NEG'), ([18], 'NEG')]
All the things you can do with the trackpad make navigating around the computer and its programs so much simpler , quicker , and easier .####[([8], 'POS'), ([10], 'POS'), ([16], 'POS')]
I guess the only good thing that came out of these were the speakers and the subwoofer .####[([13], 'POS'), ([16], 'POS')]
Theres a built in camera with special effects for video and photography .####[([2, 3, 4], 'POS')]
All for such a great price .####[([5], 'POS')]
I went right out and purchased another laptop .####[]
Long story short , since I experience so many problems with my laptop every since I bought it from day one , I did n't ask for a new laptop or a refund of what I pay for a crapy laptop , but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year , they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services , they finally gave in .####[([49], 'NEU')]
I am able to play 720p and 1080p media files just fine with it .####[]
I already own an iPhone , and so the move just made more sense .####[]
So think about factoring those things in when you purchase .####[]
Took the netbook on a vacation trip and I was able to do whatever I wanted to do without lugging a much heavier laptop .####[]
Everything was up and running within 15 minutes of unboxing .####[]
This computer gets very hot , before shutting down .####[]
Another thing is that after only a month the left mouse key broke and it costed $ 175 to send it in to fix it .####[([9, 10, 11], 'NEG'), ([15], 'NEU')]
Went silently .####[]
Satisfy what I paid for it .####[]
IT IS TRASH !####[]
Clear picture on it and everything .####[([1], 'POS')]
Overall though , for the money spent it 's a great deal .####[]
So you do n't get frustrated the first few weeks .####[]
They said that my computer was covered on an extended warranty , and that products with extended warranties are taken care of through third parties and not Sony itself anymore .####[([9, 10], 'NEU'), ([16, 17], 'NEU')]
It is truly a Desktop Replacement .####[]
I only used it to browse the internet and and I do n't know how many times it has spontaniously shut down and it is just a blank screen now .####[]
A little pricey but it is well , well worth it .####[]
Very long-life battery up to 10-11 hours depending on how you configure power level settings .####[([2], 'POS')]
Screen is awesome , battery life is good .####[([0], 'POS'), ([4, 5], 'POS')]
The black model also has a very nice seamless appearance , one of the better looking notebooks I 've seen .####[([9], 'POS')]
In my opinion it was not as user friendly as I expected either .####[]
The technical service for dell is so 3rd world it might as well not even bother .####[([1, 2, 3, 4], 'NEG')]
The graphics were awful and the warranty is n't even worth the cheap payment on the computer .####[([1], 'NEG'), ([6], 'NEG')]
and if u did .####[]
I 've had the MacBook Pro 15 for about three weeks , and it really is a great computer .####[]
They gave me a hard time yet again , but their was a malfunction in the battery itself , it did n't die .####[([16], 'NEG')]
It was definelty a smart move .####[]
I 'm excited to learn more about what this powerful machine has to offer and encourage others to do the same .####[]
Apparently they are defective since they are not securely attached .####[]
but other then that I would give this product a 4 in hafe stars .####[]
Sure hope Best Buy will replace it asap .####[]
I babyed the heck out of it and i still do .####[]
Handles all my basic media needs easily .####[]
Just what the doctor ordered .####[]
If you do n't feel comfortable doing it yourself , just buy the case and be happy , plus it looks nice , I bought the white one from Best Buy .####[([13], 'POS')]
The reaction of Toshiba is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter .####[]
you can find many laptops with the same performance and even better with lower price , but you can not find the look , easy , applications , and the experience in mac .####[([8], 'NEU'), ([14], 'POS'), ([22], 'POS'), ([26], 'POS')]
Excellent speed for processing data .####[([1], 'POS')]
All in all , I 'm incredibly dissatisfied with this laptop , and with HP as a whole .####[]
I am not happy at all with the product I purchased .####[]
When you call tech support you were routed to someone who was in another country and did not know what they were doing .####[([3, 4], 'NEG')]
I was taught to use Photoshop and was amazed .####[([5], 'POS')]
It 's A MAC ! !####[]
I can hardly wait to see whats around the next corner .####[]
the apple pro notebook will not let you down .####[]
I did a review on it , its awesome .####[]
Before we got this laptop , had a compaq pasaro for 5 years with no problems .####[]
I tried out another Mac for a few months before buying this one and it is a great machine .####[]
Somehow the system clock got messed up after reboot .####[([2, 3], 'NEG')]
the only problem is that i had to add 1 gb RAM , the computer was kinda slow .####[([11], 'NEG')]
With the macbook pro it comes with freeASPECT0 to protect it from viruses and other intrusive things from downloads and internet surfing or emails .####[]
The computer could have been shipped by Priority Mail through the USPS for the same cost and arrived by Noon on Tue .####[]
The driver updates do n't fix the issue , very frustrating .####[([1, 2], 'NEG')]
I will never go back to Windows !####[([6], 'NEG')]
Do your research on this issue .####[]
HP Pavilion DV9000 Notebook PC When I first got this computer , it really rocked .####[]
It works really well .####[([1], 'POS')]
It has happened again and I 'm being told that it 's $ 175 .####[]
Bigger HD , better graphics card , and a bid HD .####[([1], 'POS'), ([4, 5], 'POS'), ([10], 'POS')]
Lord HAVE MERCY !####[]
The built in camera is very useful when chatting with other techs in remote buildings on our campus .####[([1, 2, 3], 'POS')]
No big deal .####[]
Mine came at $ 1,700 w/o a DVD burner ! .####[([7, 8], 'NEG')]
The DVD burner broke after burning 3 DVD 'd during that time !####[([1, 2], 'NEG')]
It works fine with our wireless and they 've had not problems .####[([1], 'POS')]
But you must get the 15 inch .####[([5, 6], 'POS')]
Overall the computer is very easy to use , the screen is perfect , great computer , my daughter loves .####[([7], 'POS'), ([10], 'POS')]
The casing of the power cord fried and shocked my husband when he pulled it out of the socket .####[([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'NEG')]
It does not keep internet signals no matter where you bring it .####[([4, 5], 'NEG')]
apple is one of the best computer companies in the country .####[]
PLEASE MAKE THESE !####[]
After the first few months , the computer started crashing about every week .####[]
My son and his family have a hard time financially because he is self-employed so the family had no computer of any kind , and kyle the oldest child is 12 and really need something to help him in school .####[]
It 's a great product for a great price !####[([8], 'POS')]
Again , the same problem , the right speaker did not work .####[([7, 8], 'NEG')]
But see the macbook pro is different because it may have a huge price tag but it comes with the full software that you would actually need and most of it has free future updates .####[([21], 'POS'), ([34], 'POS')]
Before i bought my new i5 , I did my research for about 2 weeks and determined to move for HP to Apple for reliability , dependable , and long lasting operations .####[]
Dell wanted to charge us for everything everytime I called them with a problem .####[]
THIS HAS BEEN NOTHING BUT A HEADACHE SINCE WE PURCHASED IT .####[]
i have had my dell latitude for almost three years .####[]
and the multiple page viewer allows you to press one button to see every separate page currently opened at the same time in one screen are great for those who are working non stop or just shopping online .####[([2, 3, 4], 'POS')]
This was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped .####[([11], 'NEG')]
Obviously we both got new Macs .####[]
My Iphone synced right up just like a person would expect , unlike the PCs in our lives .####[]
That being said after 2 weeks of owning every time I start it up now it gives me a black screen for 5-8 seconds stating pxe-e61 media test error check cable .####[]
It 's fun to take to a bookstore , sit in the coffee shop area , sign in to WiFi and look up book reviews of books I might buy .####[]
Keyboard good sized and wasy to use .####[([0], 'POS'), ([6], 'POS')]
HP said it was out of warranty .####[([6], 'NEU')]
-Stay away from Apple , or hope you laptop does not break down .####[]
It 's a great prodcut to handle basic computing needs .####[]
I never had this kind of quality issue with Dell not to say Dell is that great , not with a brand new laptop .####[([6], 'NEG')]
wonderful features .####[([1], 'POS')]
the laptop was really good and it goes really fast just the way i thought it would of run .####[]
I had to call HP and ask for a recovery disk because the computer does not come with one and completely redo it all .####[([9, 10], 'NEG')]
Im glad that it has such great features in it .####[([7], 'POS')]
it 's just a great toy to have around .####[]
I like those programs better than Office and you can save your files to be completely compatible with the Office programs as well .####[([3], 'POS'), ([6], 'NEG'), ([19, 20], 'POS')]
Great wifi too .####[([1], 'POS')]
WHEN TYPING , LETTERS AND SPACES ARE FREQUENTLY OMITTED REQUIRING THE USER TO REDO MANY WORDS AND SENTENCES .####[([1], 'NEG')]
Only a few days after I received the computer back , the screen froze again .####[([12], 'NEG')]
It is not ideal for children because of the temp .####[([9], 'NEG')]
sounds like a typewriter , but if you can get past that , this is a great laptop for a little money !####[]
When this happened I would have to completely power off my computer and restart it .####[]
Although i do believe that Windows operating system may be to fault for some of the problems .####[([5, 6, 7], 'NEG')]
Great OS , fabulous improvements to the existing line bumping up the processor speed and adding the thunderbolt port .####[([1], 'POS'), ([12, 13], 'POS'), ([17, 18], 'POS')]
I or my dad paid over twenty four hundred dollars for everything .####[]
That includes transferring my music and movies .####[]
Images are crisp and clean .####[([0], 'POS')]
Took that one home , same thing .####[]
although its windows vista compared to windows xp sucks .####[([2, 3], 'NEG'), ([6, 7], 'POS')]
We have had numerous problems with Vista , such as Adobe Flash player just quits and has to be uninstalled and then reinsalled , Internet Explore just quits and you lose whatever you were working on , also , the same Windows update has appeared on this computer since we got it and has been update probably 400 times , the same update .####[([6], 'NEG'), ([10, 11, 12], 'NEG'), ([24, 25], 'NEG'), ([41, 42], 'NEG'), ([55], 'NEG'), ([62], 'NEG')]
The Dell mini was the first Dell product that I had ever purchased .####[]

After the bad experience with this computer went back to compaq .####[]
Finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a Walmart and there probably would be no way to find the box .####[]
It does n't heat up like my old laptop .####[]
I always have used a tower home PC and jumped to the laptop and have been very satisfied with its performance .####[([20], 'POS')]
It 's solid .####[]
Before I got my macbook , I owned a Dell laptop .####[]
This laptop is the most amazing little peice of machinery I have owned outside of the Iphone .####[]
The computer runs very fast with no problems and the iLife software that comes with it iPhoto , iMovie , iWeb , iTunes , GarageBand is all very helpful as well .####[([2], 'POS'), ([10, 11], 'POS'), ([16], 'POS'), ([18], 'POS'), ([20], 'POS'), ([22], 'POS'), ([24], 'POS')]
At first it worked well for a month or so then the system board failed and I send it in to toshiba some complaints and three weeks later I then receive my laptop back only to discover that it still has the same problem so now I have to send it back again to get it fixed again .####[([12, 13], 'NEG')]

However , my girlfriend realized that the netbook 's hinge is a bit loose when you open or close the LCD .####[([9], 'NEG'), ([20], 'NEU')]
My problem was with DELL Customer Service .####[([4, 5, 6], 'NEG')]
There are so many things wrong with this product , it just makes me want to set my self on fire !####[]
It is not even a year old yet , so I would definitely not recommend it to anyone .####[]
Amazing machine .####[]
I do n't do any high tech stuff on it , just write papers , check mail , and sometimes play games , so I ca n't reccomend it if you are in the computer field .####[]
Newegg 's RMA service was great as always , I contacted them late Friday night , and they issued me an RMA number and a PrePaid UPS shipping label the very next morning on Saturday .####[([2, 3], 'POS')]

The screen is framed by half to a full-inch margin that is obviously unnecessary , reduces the screen size and increases the bulk .####[([1], 'NEG'), ([17], 'NEG'), ([22], 'NEG')]

A SECOND PROBLEM INVOLVES THE BATTERY WHICH IS ADVERTISED AS HAVING A STORAGE LIFE OF 11 HOURS BUT WHEN FULLY CHARGED SHOWS ONLY 7 HOURS OF SERVICE .####[([5], 'NEG'), ([26], 'NEG')]
and plenty of storage with 250 gbthough I will upgrade this and the ram .####[([3], 'POS'), ([13], 'NEU')]
I had to call Apple 19 times each time 40 to 75 minutes on the phone , and take it to their store for evaluations , and diagnostics , 5 times .####[]
No temporary replacement , they are out of replacements because many computers had problems with the Nvidia chipset status of repair .####[([16, 17], 'NEG')]
I took it to friend who temporarily fixed it and I finally paid about 1500 for the extended warranty .####[([17, 18], 'NEU')]
I respond that I do not have the old computer .####[]
I homeschool my kids and with this netbook next to my desk we get to teaching and illustrating without skipping a beat .####[]
Programs would crash all the time , and it turned out to be a very unstable , unreliable laptop for me .####[([0], 'NEG')]
I BOUGHT THIS LAP TOP AND THE CHARGE TIME DOSE N'T LAST AS LONG AS THEY SAY IT WILL MORE LIKE 2 HOURS####[([7, 8], 'NEG')]
Also , because of the size and consistancy of the laptop computer , some websites would n't even attempt to work on the computer because of browser problems .####[([5], 'NEG'), ([7], 'NEG')]
I work with kids and they love making short videos on there .####[]
It is very durable , I am pretty rough when it comes to electronics and it has taken it all with no reprecutions yet .####[]
the key bindings take a little getting used to , but have loved the Macbook Pro .####[([1, 2], 'NEG')]
Keyboard is reasonable size .####[([0], 'POS'), ([3], 'POS')]
Instead it is sitting in West Verginia waiting for UPS to take two days to send Me a box and Two days for them to ship the computer some 691 miles by air ? to Louisville Ky .####[]
I 'm now trying to decide on another Dell model .####[]
I find myself using the 10-key more than I thought I would .####[([5], 'POS')]
The Macbook is a fantastic laptop .####[]
I believe this is because I was more active than the average user , meaning I average about three tabs .####[]
Best Buy Rocks !####[]
A couple things you should know ,####[]
bought the first asus laptop in san francisco , returned it in santa maria , thinking it was just a problem with that computer .####[]
The screen is bright and clear , the operating system is solid and friendly to a novice .####[([1], 'POS'), ([8, 9], 'POS')]
It has a 1 ghz faster processor and a stock 500gb hard drive .####[([6], 'POS'), ([10, 11, 12], 'POS')]
The feature are good enough for what I need .####[([1], 'POS')]
All the yada-yada .####[]
Finally , the biggest problem has been tech support .####[([7, 8], 'NEG')]
this laptop is great for work and doing my pictures .####[]
I had the computer for a full year and it was a new computer .####[]
This is n't a big deal , I have n't noticed the issue with DVDs or other media , only through USB output .####[([21, 22], 'NEG')]
I love it !####[]
With Windows laptops a wireless mouse is an absolute must .####[([4, 5], 'NEU')]
I had been a Windows user before this I love the size because the screen is big enough for what I use it for Internet , artwork , and yet it is small enough to be reasonably portable .####[([4], 'NEU'), ([11], 'POS'), ([14], 'POS')]
But if you 're willing to pay another 200 dollar for a windows disc .####[([12, 13], 'NEU')]
Very good quality and well made .####[([2], 'POS')]
I bought a Logitech desktop set in anticipation for using with the MBP , but I use the touchpad 90 % of the time .####[([18], 'POS')]
When calling Dell for help , reurn , or a new computer they were not useful and left it up to myself to figure out what to do with it .####[]
Two of the times was in one month .####[]
my niece and nephew have played a few web games and it runs anything that does n't require a dedicated video card .####[([20, 21], 'NEU')]
Although I was promised about 10 hours , I found myself to a limited 7 hours which is still amazing .####[]
It had the full sized touch pad with 2 buttons instead of just one .####[([5, 6], 'NEU')]
It was also cheaper than the Pro which made it even more appealing to me .####[]
Typically , when I purchase a new laptop I always end up using an external mouse for convenience .####[([14, 15], 'NEU')]
Consumer Report recommended Toshiba .####[]
Needless to say I told them No and have a nice day and hung up !####[]
It was super easy to set up and Is really easy to get used to .####[([5, 6], 'POS')]
The only thing that can be updated is the video , other than that you 're all set .####[([9], 'NEG')]
It was n't worth it .####[]
Its a good laptop for its value .####[([6], 'POS')]
ANd I babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke .####[]
Probbly the worst decision we ever made !####[]
Then the hard drive failed ;####[([2, 3], 'NEG')]
This computer literally takes about five minutes to start up and to be able to use without it crawling and I DO mean crawling .####[]
I had less problems .####[]
It will be returned in the state to which it was shipped Michigan .####[]
This machine rocks !####[]
My next laptop will also be a Mac !####[]
But not in this case .####[]
taking notes , research , an online class and such and did n't want to spend too much on my first machine .####[]
When I got this laptop in 2007 to help me with school , I had a hard time from beginning .####[]
I do not know for sure .####[]
No machine has come remotely close to causing as many problems .####[]
Every single one we 've gotten we 've had problems with .####[]
it is the worst computer dell ever made .####[]
About 1/2 of the sites I need to visit because of my work contain some type of Flash .####[]
This is a great value for the money .####[([4], 'POS')]
It was a great laptop , ran great and was really fast .####[([6], 'POS')]
The battery has never worked well .####[([1], 'NEG')]
return it .####[]
I can guarantee this will be the last Dell I will ever purchase !####[]
They said it was a computer error on this type of computer .####[]
I will never buy another computer from Dell ever again do to how awful it worked and how I was treated by the company .####[([23], 'NEG')]
My review mainly talks about the difference I have felt between an early 2011 and late 2011 mac book pro .####[]
The only problem is a lack of screen resolutions !####[([7, 8], 'NEG')]
Typing on the keyboard becomes uncomfortable after extended use due to the sharp edges that your wrists rest on .####[([3], 'NEG'), ([13], 'NEG')]
It has many great programs , such as ILife , iPhotos and others .####[([4], 'POS'), ([8], 'POS'), ([10], 'POS')]
Other Thoughts , Received replacement 16 Days later .####[]
If the number of patrons in the Apple store are any indication , HP and other PC manufacturers need to take note .####[]
The processor went on me , the fan went and the motherboard went .####[([1], 'NEG'), ([7], 'NEG'), ([11], 'NEG')]
I bought my first MacBook after seeing the product demonstrated .####[]
It is very well built .####[([4], 'POS')]
Might not make the avid gamer happy but I do n't really think that is what this computer is designed for .####[]
I highly recommend this laptop to anybody that wants great performance from a laptop and would like to relax and not become enraged cursing the gods about to throw your laptop out the door .####[([10], 'POS')]
The screen resolution was exactly what I was looking for .####[([1, 2], 'POS')]
Even though it is running Snow Leopard , 24 GHz C2D is a bit of an antiquated CPU and thus the occasional spinning wheel would appear when running Office Mac applications such as Word or Excel .####[([5, 6], 'POS'), ([17], 'NEG'), ([22, 23], 'NEG'), ([28, 29, 30], 'NEG'), ([33], 'NEG'), ([35], 'NEG')]
seriously why have n't they just replaced it by now .####[]
There is no number pad to the right of the keyboard which is a bummer .####[([4], 'NEG'), ([10], 'NEG')]
After 20-30 min the screen of the notebook switched off .####[([4], 'NEG')]
If upgrade is possible to the full Windows 7 , then I will truly be a very happy geek .####[([7, 8], 'POS')]
I have used both PCs and Macs and I have to say that I really really love my Mac Book Pro .####[]
I was originally concerned that I could n't view work I had done in college on my Mac because of the PC formatting , but I was even more thrilled to learn of programs like iLife and iWork that allow you to convert your PC documents into readable files on Macs .####[([33], 'POS'), ([35], 'POS'), ([37], 'POS')]
It is a big big , but since it has a 184 screen what would you expect ! .####[]
I have never had an experience like this .####[]
returned it to walmart .####[]
10 hours of battery life is really something else .####[([3, 4], 'POS')]
I love everything about it .####[]
It 's slow and one day i hope to have the money to get rid of it and buy something else .####[]
Runs fast and the regular layout keyboard is so much better .####[([0], 'POS'), ([4, 5, 6], 'POS')]
All was well .####[]
All the programs are easy and straight forward on my MacBook Pro , it is clean and organized , which I always strive to be myself .####[([2], 'POS')]
Not worth it one bit .####[]
I just ca n't fathom that the celebrated Dell would last a week in environment of free competition with normal products , it only survives b/c its substandard laptops are forced onto captive students and employees through question-raising programs .####[]
I reinstalled windows through the recovery discs and everything seemed good again .####[([2], 'POS'), ([5, 6], 'POS')]
Windows 7 Starter is terrific no you ca n't change the background but I do n't need to , I use it just for school work .####[([0, 1, 2], 'POS')]
Support has been lackluster and now I just want a refund .####[([0], 'NEG')]
First of all , they had no record of me having the 3 year warranty I 'd paid almost $ 400 for , and I had to call in , spend hours on their online chat service , and fax in multiple documents .####[([12, 13, 14], 'NEG'), ([34, 35, 36], 'NEG')]
I hate to say this , but if I could take this back to the shop and get my money back , then I would .####[]
It makes doing schoolwork at night so much easier .####[]
Being only 2 months old , I am not a happy camper !####[]
> iPhoto is probably the best program I have ever worked with , easy and convenient .####[([1], 'POS')]
I love to write and play with graphics and html programming and my new Toshiba works great on both !####[([15], 'POS')]
THis computer may be small but it is one heck of a power horse .####[]
They would repair one thing , send it back and it would still have the same problem .####[]
Such as PAGES , NUMBERS , and so on .####[]
My laptop now has no battery .####[([5], 'NEG')]
Beta had better quality , but VHS became the industry standard .####[]
It made the computer much easier to use and navigate .####[([7], 'POS'), ([9], 'POS')]
, -If you buy this , do n't go into it expecting 7 hrs of battery life , and you 'll be perfectly satisfied .####[([15, 16], 'NEG')]
Needs longer lasting battery , More than 1 to 2 Hrs .####[([3], 'NEG')]
in May I started having problems with the USB ports not working .####[([8, 9], 'NEG')]
10 plus hours of battery .####[([4], 'POS')]
If only Bill Gates would read some of what is said here MS would do a better job .####[]
The design is awesome , quality is unprecedented .####[([1], 'POS'), ([5], 'POS')]
I 'm going to try and keep my old G4 on the road for as long as possible .####[]
The Mac version of Microsoft Office is cheaper than buying the actual and works just as well .####[([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'POS')]
The Mac takes about the same amount of starting-up time as the average PC , but keeps itself cleaned up and ready to use .####[([8, 9], 'POS')]
Its hard to encounter a problem on a mac that would require such abrupt action .####[]
The Toshiba Net book operates very well .####[([4], 'POS')]
I loved it .####[]
the touch pad is fine , again , it 's a real touch pad .####[([1, 2], 'POS'), ([12, 13], 'POS')]
It is also very lightweight , making transporting this computer very easy .####[([7], 'POS')]
If anything , I would only suggest using one of these laptops if only you have to .####[]
I sit down and use my husband 's work PC and I do n't like it one bit .####[]
It 's wonderful for computer gaming .####[([5], 'POS')]
AND the best part is that it even comes with a free printer when they have a certain promotion/offer going , of course !####[([12], 'POS')]
the place we bought it from said that after they send it out to gateway 4 times they would give us a new one .####[]
it is very easy for anyone to use an apple and specially the mcbook pro notebook .####[([7], 'POS')]
I like it better than my big Dell Laptop .####[]
The flaws are , this computer is not for computer gamers because of the OS X .####[([14, 15], 'NEG')]
I tried giving it 0 stars but I had to choose at least one , but IMO NO STARS####[]
They really do have the worlds very worst repair service .####[([8, 9], 'NEG')]
They need to stop outsoucing and send some complaint calls to US based customer service agents for those who live in the United states .####[([13, 14, 15], 'NEG')]
I was also able to install and use my Photoshop and AfterEffects programs easily .####[([9], 'POS'), ([11, 12], 'POS')]
for being so small it is amazing that it is as fast as it is .####[]
Heck , I like all Mac computers , but they 're all WAY too pricey for the kind of economy the US is going through .####[]
They claim that I should be happy because I am getting a new laptop to replace my two-month old laptop .####[]
I 'm already hooked on the sleek look and dependability that this laptop has shown .####[([7], 'POS'), ([9], 'POS')]
The machine itself is alright .####[]
It seems to have some opions that are intalled but do not work like I thought they would .####[]
And having to deal with the company has been a even worse nightmare .####[([6], 'NEG')]
I will definitely be getting a new laptop if it has any more issues after the warranty expires and researching carefully when I do so I do n't run accross a situation like this again !####[([16], 'NEU')]
I also experience the same with my MacBook Air .####[]
It has all the features that are necessary for college and if not they are able to be added onto the computer .####[([4], 'POS')]
I have owned many different brands of laptops in my life .####[]
I did an internet search and this is a very common problem with this laptop .####[]
I 've owned this labtop for less then two months , already the mouse button has broke .####[([13, 14], 'NEG')]
It did fairly well , other than it 's poor performance , overheating and occational blue screen .####[([10], 'NEG')]
The touchpad is very intuitive , so much so that I never want to use buttons to click again !####[([1], 'POS'), ([15], 'NEU')]
tons of bloatware and junk programs .####[([5], 'NEG')]
its sad because their commercials are great .####[]
lots of extra space but the keyboard is ridiculously small .####[([3], 'POS'), ([6], 'NEG')]
Luckily , Dell said they would replace my laptop with a new one , but instead I got a refund and bought a mac .####[]
I decided to get this pile of crap on a whim and totally freaking regret it .####[]
Never been hacked .####[]
Good keyboard , long battery life , largest hard drive and windows 7 .####[([1], 'POS'), ([4, 5], 'POS'), ([8, 9], 'POS'), ([11, 12], 'POS')]
I think it was seventy nine plus tax .####[]
In summary , take your money elsewhere .####[]
The processor is very quick and effective as I load webpages and applications .####[([1], 'POS'), ([9, 10], 'NEU'), ([12], 'NEU')]
My battery went bad about a year and a half after having it and it cost around eighty to a hundred dollars !####[([1], 'NEG')]
I will NEVER buy Refurbished again , I do n't cae how cheap it is .####[]
It pretty much does everything we could ever need , and looks great to boot .####[([14], 'POS')]
Bottom line , I doubt you 'd be overly disappointed if you invest in this machine .####[]
As a lifelong Windows user , I was extremely pleased to make the change to Mac .####[([3], 'NEG')]
So , owing to these problems , I went out and got myself an Apple MacBook Pro , which I am using with great satisfaction at this very moment .####[]
The Macbook Pro is extremely thin and light compared to those heavy Windows Laptop .####[]
So this was great for me .####[]
This is the first macbook I have ever had .####[]
The acer one compuer is a great computer .####[]
another problem .####[]
The Macbook is also made better , my computer has never got a virus , and the laptop runs just as fast as the first day I bought it .####[([18], 'POS')]
So , if you 're thinking of a laptop , I would heartily recommend theApple 133 MacBook Pro Notebook Computer Z0J80001 Notebook for all your needs ! .####[]
I picked it out becaASPECT0 it was inexpensive $ 400 and I thought it would be a good , easy to use first laptop .####[([21], 'POS')]
The Time remaining goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes .####[]
Pay attention to the specs if you want these options .####[([4], 'NEU')]
Stupidly , mind-numbingly slow -- then I found it can only be loaded with 2GB *maximum* .####[]
It also does not have bluetooth .####[([5], 'NEG')]
Being a PC user my whole life .####[]
great battery life .####[([1, 2], 'POS')]
The real stand out on this computer is the feel of the keyboard and it 's speed .####[([12], 'POS'), ([16], 'POS')]
At first , the computer seemed a great deal -- seemingly high-end specs for a low , low price .####[([12], 'POS'), ([18], 'POS')]
Delivery was early too .####[([0], 'POS')]
During that time , I had to send it back 3 times .####[]
Although I opted for the lowest end MacBook Pro , this thing holds its own .####[]
And that probably explains why I 've already had my SATA controller go bad within a year of buying it .####[([10, 11], 'NEG')]
I my wife is also now the proud owner of a Macbook as well !####[]
I 've had a Toshiba laptop in the past ;####[]
It 's also very capable of doing moderate video editing although you may need the performance boost of the larger MacBook Pros for heavy duty mobile video editing .####[([8, 9], 'POS'), ([15], 'NEG'), ([26, 27], 'POS')]
ASUS said my net-book was working properly .####[]
I received this laptop as a gift and let me just tell you that its the worst .####[]
Very annoying .####[]
My main reason to convert was the imovie program .####[([7, 8], 'POS')]
It has a faster processor and more ram .####[([4], 'POS'), ([7], 'POS')]
If you need an affordable , entry-level laptop , this will fit the bill .####[]
Laptops are usually used on the go , so why not give you a better battery ?####[([15], 'NEG')]
I will never complain about the price since I believe you get what you pay for and my MacBook Pro was worth every dollar .####[]
I was n't a big fan of the Netbooks but this one was very well designed .####[([15], 'POS')]
It may take a little getting used to but you do n't have to worry about viruses or other headaches .####[]
And the warranty on this macbook pro can last up to 5 years or 1000 battery recharge cycles .####[([2], 'POS')]
I still have that stupid bluetooth mouse to !####[([5, 6], 'NEG')]
Would like more trendy , high tech features .####[([7], 'NEG')]
Keyboard is great but primary and secondary control buttons could be more durable .####[([0], 'POS'), ([7, 8], 'NEG')]
Screen is a bit glossy , but that 's not too bad .####[]
Received the product promptly and without any issues .####[]
I remind myself from time to time to take off my watch when ever I look at the small scratch that it has caused .####[]
I got it back again and was told the motherboard had been replaced , so I was now on the SECOND motherboard within 3 months .####[([9], 'NEG'), ([21], 'NEG')]
But reasons we chose this Apple computer .####[]
Processor , When compared to my 3 week old Early 2011 edition there I barely experience any difference in performance 23 GHz v/s 24 GHz .####[([0], 'NEU'), ([19], 'NEU')]
They say it could be the motherboard again , but Dell####[([6], 'NEG')]
I upgraded from a 5 year old laptop and was amazed to find out that this computer is much slower then my old laptop .####[]
2nd Best computer in the world only one way this computer might become the best is that it needs to upgreade patches to make less easier for people to hack into####[([21], 'NEG')]
Love the speed , especially !####[([2], 'POS')]
It could be a perfect laptop if it would have faster system memory and its radeon 5850 would have DDR5 instead of DDR3 .####[([11, 12], 'NEG'), ([15, 16], 'NEG'), ([19], 'POS'), ([22], 'NEG')]
Not only are the versions of these programs able to be saved , worked on and opened on both a PC and Mac , the versions of these programs on a Mac are graphically and functionally superior .####[([7], 'POS'), ([28], 'POS')]
By Air sounds more like by truck to Me .####[]
So far it has been five months since the last problem was fixed and I am PRAYING it has finally stopped .####[]
It 's outstanding too .####[]
The speed gives you the power to work on these projects seamlessly , and multiple at a time if you sowish .####[([1], 'POS')]
Awesome laptop and the perfect size to carry around in college .####[([5], 'POS')]
So I 'm disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority .####[]
A MONTH LATER , we reinstall the OS (Vista) .####[([7, 8], 'NEG')]
Some problems can be fixed if you purchase new software , but there is no guarentee .####[([9], 'NEG')]
just chill and enjoy .####[]
The battery life is also relatively good .####[([1, 2], 'POS')]
It is her first laptop and she is thrilled .####[]
I should have sent it back to them then .####[]
I definitely suggest getting an extended warranty , you will probably need it !####[([5, 6], 'POS')]
If this would be your first Mac purchase then I would highly suggest that you take advantage of the class that they offer to learn about the differences between Mac and PC 's .####[]
This laptop leaves alot to be desired , I have had it only 5 months and have had to send it away to be repaired twice .####[]
I have found it very easy to use , very imformative , wonder alerts and tutorials making it very easy for someone like me who is not exactly technologically advanced to learn to use the various features and programs .####[([7], 'POS'), ([33], 'POS'), ([36], 'POS'), ([38], 'POS')]
I do n't have stupid pop up windows even when I have pop ups blocked , I do n't have to wait 5 minutes for a webpage to download , and best of all I can run all the web programming software I need to use all at once without slowing me down .####[([5, 6, 7], 'POS'), ([12, 13], 'NEU'), ([39, 40, 41], 'POS')]
I bought this laptop so that the entire family had a computer in the living room ;####[]
Do n't waste your money or time .####[]
It has spent more time in repair shops than i can possibly recount here .####[]
Memory is upgradable .####[([0], 'POS')]
Web access through the 3G network is so slow , it 's very frustrating and VERY DISAPPOINTING .####[([0, 1], 'NEG'), ([4, 5], 'NEG')]
Well , I bought this laptop a month or two ago .####[]
My MacBook Pro has been a huge disappointment .####[]
Received all four in good order ;####[]
The computer first started malfunctioning 3 months after purchasing it .####[]
this is starting off good .####[]
The large screen also helps when you are working in design based programs like Adobe Creative Suite .####[([2], 'POS'), ([10, 11, 12], 'NEU'), ([14, 15, 16], 'NEU')]
The only pro to this computer is it was under $ 600 !####[]
Moral of the story , -Do not buy anything from companies that do not respect their customers .####[([10], 'NEG')]
This is my first Dell I heard their customer service was lacking and that they were working on improving it !####[([8, 9], 'NEG')]
As well as having the plug in the computer come loose .####[([5], 'NEG')]
Very small and portable I 've had this netbook about 12 hrs now and It 's better than expected .####[]
NOT WITH APPLE .####[]
After 3 pleasant weeks of use , the laptop just died .####[]
Each time taking about 1 day or so .####[]
Second HDD cover has walls inside that need to be broken if you what to install one .####[([1, 2], 'NEU')]
If you want more information on macs I suggest going to applecom and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the applications .####[([23], 'NEU')]
So a couple of years later , I was a dumb college girl and had to have the wireless internet .####[]
This netbook went bad on me after 3 days .####[]
Probably wo n't work either .####[]
Great product by Apple with the new great looking design .####[([9], 'POS')]
I love the keyboard .####[([3], 'POS')]
Probably as good as you can get in a netbook , does everything I ask for and has some very good unexpected pluses .####[]
Overall I am very satisfied with the purchase .####[]
In my line of work , I often have to take work home , and this makes it so easy .####[]
They told me to reprogram the computer , and I did n't need to do that , and I lost pictures of my oldests first 2 years of her life .####[]
I bought this laptop for my son in 2007 for his Christmas present .####[]
It took so much time .####[]
The screen is n't huge , but that does n't matter when I output media to the 50 inch LCD TV .####[]
I 'll stick to Tashiba .####[]
I will have to purchase Spy ware or Nortell for privacy protection .####[([5, 6], 'NEU'), ([8], 'NEU')]
You will not regret buying such a great thing like this !####[]
I was said it 's videocard .####[([5], 'NEG')]
Plus stylish .####[]
For the price and what I get out of it has exceeded my expectations .####[([2], 'POS')]
And , if you are going to deal with HP be careful .####[]
I took the computer into Best Buy where I purchased it and they kept it over night to study it .####[]
If your time is worth anything to you , if you are tired of rebooting , reformatting , reinstalling , trying to find drivers , if you want a computer to work for you for a change , make the change to this computer .####[([23], 'NEG')]
My MacBook Pro is no exception .####[]
Unless you do n't care how long it takes to get going , find something else .####[]
You may be reading one now !####[]
The only thing I wish is the 15 inch MacBook Pro has much better speakers on the side of the keyboard .####[([14], 'NEG'), ([20], 'NEU')]
I will have to say that I love my MacBook Pro !####[]
In fact , he said , about 10 % of their products fail .####[]
This is the first Apple product that I have purchased .####[]
Now , as easy as it is to use , and I do think it is a great STARTER laptop .####[([8], 'POS')]
This causes my wrist to scrape up against it .####[]
Enough said .####[]
Setting would change for some reason , the screen size would change on it 's own , like the pixel sizes and whatnot .####[([0], 'NEG'), ([8, 9], 'NEG'), ([19, 20], 'NEG')]
It had some kind of pre installed software update that completely shut the computer down when you clicked it .####[([5, 6, 7, 8], 'NEG')]
Ever since I bought this laptop , so far I 've experience nothing but constant break downs of the laptop and bad customer services I received over the phone with toshiba customer services hotlines .####[([22, 23], 'NEG'), ([31, 32], 'NEG')]
I do not plan on going back .####[]
No laptop is perfect , but sometimes you just find a computer that works for you .####[]
I really like the Mac 154in Notebook , but its very pricey .####[]
Also , the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it .####[([3, 4], 'NEG')]
iPhotos is an excellent program for storing and organizing photos .####[([0], 'POS'), ([4], 'POS')]
Other than that its a great performing machine and well meets all my needs and more .####[([6], 'POS')]
We were occasional Mac users before , but most recently owned a budget PC since it is what we could afford .####[]
Called tech support and got the usual Acer We do n't support software but for $ $ $ we can help you I explained there was no software involved in booting .####[([12], 'NEG'), ([27], 'NEG'), ([30], 'NEG')]
I would never tell anyone to buy one either .####[]
The programs are great , like iphoto love the editing capabilities , imail which can incorporate with the address book on the ipod and ipad , imovie , etc .####[([1], 'POS'), ([6], 'POS'), ([12], 'POS'), ([26], 'POS')]
The only thing I did n't learn in my research was the software I would need like privacy protection and warranty protection , in case it gets broken , or crashes etc .####[([12], 'NEU')]
I ca n't say enough good for it !####[]
Comfterbale to use light easy to transport .####[([2], 'POS'), ([6], 'POS')]
The Computer itself is a good product but the repair depot stinks .####[([9, 10], 'NEG')]
I was tired of going without my laptop every few weeks .####[]
the only down fall is that it has no cd drive but i found that they are very cheap to by and also very portable making this the best friend to someone who is always looking for more space then they have .####[([9, 10], 'NEG')]
So , the hard disk capacity really does n't matter to me .####[([3, 4, 5], 'NEU')]
Keys stick periodically and I havent had the laptop for 45 days yet .####[([0], 'NEG')]
It crashes , and when it goes flat , it just DIES like a PC , maybe worse and I loose all my open documents !####[]
I also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad .####[([16], 'POS')]
Everything from the design to the OS is simple and to the point .####[([3], 'POS'), ([6], 'POS')]
I am now making a point to avoid their products and I hope my experience can serve as a warning to you as well .####[]
I'v spent as much for shipping as I would to buy a new netbook - of course a different brand .####[([5], 'NEG')]
I personally like the gaming look but needed a machine that delivered gaming performance while still looking professional in front of my customers .####[([4, 5], 'POS'), ([12, 13], 'POS')]
When you look at the specs on Apple products in comparison to a Dell or a HP , yes they do seem to offer less for a higher cost .####[([28], 'NEG')]
Then I proceed to tell her that I checked out other retail stores that carry the netbook and it was n't LIKE THAT .####[]
Then they had me jump through many hoops and questions to see if they could find another way to invalidate me .####[]
The only downfall is the volume control .####[([5, 6], 'NEG')]
Clearly , there is something wrong with the product and LG did n't take up the responsibility .####[]
Very fast boot up and shut down .####[([2, 3], 'POS'), ([5, 6], 'POS')]
Right out of the box , this little netbook did everything I asked of it , including streaming the everyday video you 're bound to encounter checking mail and websites my biggest complaint previously .####[]
I am very happy with this laptop .####[]
this laptop is durable and it is easy to travel with .####[]
I finally decided on this laptop because it was the right price for what I need it .####[([11], 'POS')]
What a mistake !####[]
If internet connectivity is important I would recommend going with a dell net book for 50 bucks more , or buy a USB wireless card .####[([1, 2], 'NEU'), ([22, 23, 24], 'NEU')]
I had read online that some users were having sound problems .####[([9], 'NEG')]
My last computer , a Toshiba , cost only $ 400 , and worked like a charm for many years .####[([7], 'POS')]
It discharges too quickly .####[([1], 'NEG')]
But to be honest , the compatibility issues and the other little quirks make me think I ll buy a PC next time .####[([6], 'NEG')]
three years is a decent life , but this must make it to graduation and beyond .####[]
I work on a PC at home and have used Pc all through college .####[]
TOSHIBA WILL NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THIS PROBLEM .####[]
Then it ceased charging at all .####[([3], 'NEG')]
An absolutely hateful machine that no one should get of their own free will .####[]
Webcam is a bit laggy , not the greatest .####[([0], 'NEG')]
I am not much of a computer techie , so I can understand some of the internal problems , though I do have trend micro as an antiviral program .####[([23, 24], 'NEU'), ([27, 28], 'NEU')]
Stay away from HP .####[]
The computer continued to give me issues and in Late June it completely died again and I tried to call Acer again to get it fixed and they refused to help me , they said my warrenty was up and hung up on me .####[([36], 'NEG')]
I 've have n't had any major problems with the laptop except that the plastic piece that covers the usb port wires have all come off .####[([14, 15], 'NEG'), ([19, 20, 21], 'NEU')]
Wonderful sleek case design is only on the outside .####[([2, 3], 'POS')]
It is speedy when connected wirelessly to any network regardless if the connection is weak or not .####[([12], 'NEU')]
I like it !####[]
The pricing is very competitive .####[([1], 'POS')]
so we got a good deal on hsn for an ascer notebook and we bought it for him .####[]
Connecting to my wireless router via built-in wireless took no time at all .####[([6, 7], 'POS')]
Its still going .####[]
This computer is exceptionally thin for it 's screen size and processing power .####[([8, 9], 'POS'), ([11, 12], 'POS')]
I have not had a problem with the applications quitting or freezing .####[([8], 'POS')]
Prior to this computer , I owned a PowerBook G4 for 6 years quite a long time for a laptop .####[]
The advantages of owning a mac are numerous .####[]
I challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than 25 hrs out of it .####[]
This wiped out several programs that were installed on the computer when it was bought .####[([4], 'NEG')]
On the twelfth day that I had the notebook , I decided to go to Dell 's website and update it .####[]
The computer blinks it shuts off at will .####[]
Excellent product for the money .####[]
It 's graphics are n't bad at all , for the lower end of the MacBook Pro spectrum , easily capable of running StarCraft II and other games with comparable graphics .####[([2], 'POS'), ([30], 'POS')]
I have Vista , so I am unable to install and unASPECT2 some programs .####[([2], 'NEG'), ([9], 'NEG'), ([13], 'NEG')]
The screen is bright and vivid and the keyboard is very easy to use , very important for use quick typers .####[([1], 'POS'), ([8], 'POS')]
I can do everything I could before , only faster and more efficiently .####[]
I called Toshiba and they want me to be without my laptop for about two weeks while they look at the problem .####[]
the mouse jumps around all the time and it clicks stuff i do n't want it too .####[([1], 'NEG')]
i do n't understand why i spent twice as much to get a laptop rather than a desktop when my lap top is completely immoble .####[]
For those that care about noise this thing does n't really make any ;####[([5], 'POS')]
Here we are another year later and the computer is doing the same thing .####[]
Despite the plethora of problems , I managed to use technological trickery to keep the machine operational for two years .####[]
I had my IWORKS , Itunes , Email , MS Office , network and printers set up and completely working perfectly within an hour .####[([3], 'POS'), ([5], 'POS'), ([9, 10], 'POS')]
Simply amazing computer ! !####[]
I first purchased this Dell model 1764 on April 6 , 201####[]
The macbooks are small enough to be very portable yet hold tons of information and performance .####[([15], 'POS')]
Two times with in one month .####[]
The only downfall is a lot of the software I have wo n't work with Mac and iWork is not worth the price of it .####[([8], 'NEG'), ([17], 'NEG'), ([22], 'NEG')]
Waited on getting this computer , but it has been a great change .####[]
For my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin it happened 7 months ago they offered me an ITouch 8Gig you know it is a bit insulating when a company this rich , offer a loyal customer like me , a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this .####[]
BUT there 's this application called Boot Camp which allows you to add another OS X like Windows .####[([4], 'NEU'), ([6, 7], 'NEU'), ([14, 15], 'NEU'), ([17], 'NEU')]
The mousepad is a huge pain in the arse !####[([1], 'NEG')]
I hope to edit this in the next few hours , I am going to try to install my own copy of Windows 7 .####[([22, 23], 'NEU')]
If it 's not shipped on the next business day , called on a Friday they are closed on weekends , what was the next step .####[]
I also purchased Applecare for $ 300 , which is a three year extended warranty , since I ve never seen any laptop that lasted more than two .####[([3], 'NEU'), ([13, 14], 'NEU')]
I have had the netbook for 2 months and I love it , I read some reviews that say netbooks are slow but it does not seem any slower than the other computers I use .####[]
C'mon , LG .####[]
Whenever I call Dell about an unrelated problem , they ask me if my laptop is running slowly and if I 'd like to purchase more memory for $ 75 .####[([26], 'NEU')]
since then i have had minor problems with slow operation .####[([9], 'NEG')]
If you faintly come close to touching this thing while typing , all craziness may break loose .####[]
Registration/1st use is easy .####[([1], 'POS')]
Finally was able to reach a young lady in California and ordered the machine and was subsequently given a delivery date .####[]
I definitely will buy a Mac again if and when this computer ever fails .####[]
The Toshiba Mini Notebook , Model NB 305-N410BL , is a great little computer .####[]
Take your time and go through the tutorials patiently .####[([7], 'NEU')]
So if anyones looking to buy a computer or laptop you should stay far far away from any that have the name TOSHIBA on it .####[]
I 'm an excellent touch typist , and my hands are very sensitive , too .####[]
This time the mouse pad and right click key would n't work !####[([3, 4], 'NEG'), ([6, 7, 8], 'NEG')]
EVENTUALLY we pushed hard enough to convince them that this was the MACHINE that was causing the problems .####[]
The first full charge of this battery got me only about 2 full hours .####[([2, 3], 'NEG'), ([6], 'NEG')]
I bought a cordless mouse for it , but do n't always take it out ;####[([3, 4], 'POS')]
When I got it , I immediately noticed that it was quite heavy and thick and not really attractive .####[]
It is sleek , smooth , and lightweight .####[]
i am a huge computer person i love anykind of computer that works well , but when i got this one i was so happy with the way it works and how it runs its amazing .####[([33], 'POS')]
They only stay charged a little over an hour .####[([3], 'NEG')]
Now they are believers in the product .####[]
Had to have this computer repaired twice in the first 5 months after purchasing it .####[]
Hewlett Packard HP Pavillion DV6000 Laptop is the worst laptop we have ever bought .####[]
I had never owned a Mac before ;####[]
I could not find a phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for tech support and had to result the their online chat .####[([15, 16], 'NEG'), ([23, 24], 'NEU')]
i try to use it today and I ca n't logon .####[]
Keyboard could use some trimming .####[([0], 'NEG')]
The bottom-line is that this laptop just is n't worth it .####[]
I returned the computer to HP and they kept it for 3 months .####[]
Its white color is stylish for college students and easy to take to carry and take to classes .####[([2], 'POS')]
Returned laptop for repair a 2nd time and it came back with obvious physical damage keyboard bulging and speaker grill pressed in , buttons not working and USB ports inoperative .####[([15], 'NEG'), ([18, 19], 'NEG'), ([23], 'NEG'), ([27, 28], 'NEG')]
When I am next to my router on my HP I get full service , on my Eee PC I get 3 bars .####[]
I got assurances from 2 different people that the remaining 10 months of my warranty would transfer to the new computer .####[([14], 'POS')]
Pretty disappointed about this product .####[]
The letter A stopped working after the first week .####[([1, 2], 'NEG')]
By the time I was finally able to get a work order to get it fixed I had been without my computer for almost a week while I was an Online College Student , so it was very inconvenient and I had to send it off and be without it while it was being fixed also .####[]
Maybe it 's Acer , maybe it 's MSFT .####[]
So if you want a good machine that does almost anything this is the one , if you want a low budget computer then look at the other great brands Best Buy sells .####[]
I took off a star because the machine has a lot of junk software on it .####[([13], 'NEG')]
I would buy one of these for every person in my office if I could .####[]
With what I do know how to do , the computer works beautiful .####[([11], 'POS')]
HAVING HAD EXPERIENCE WITH A TOSHIBA LAPTOP , I WAS DISAPPOINTED TO FIND THAT THE TOSHIBA NB305 LAPTOP HAS MAJOR PROBLEMS .####[]
Tried to make a recovey disk would n't get passed the first recovery disk .####[([4, 5], 'NEG'), ([12, 13], 'NEG')]
Most everything is fine with this machine , speed , capacity , build .####[([8], 'POS'), ([10], 'POS'), ([12], 'POS')]
I have never had it crash , randomly turn off####[]
For the same price , you get a lot more in the Asus1920x1080 res .####[([3], 'NEG')]
I made a photo book as a gift , on my computer , pushed Buy and it drew from my iTunes account and sent the book to my house , the book was of perfect quality-exactly how I had created it and looked better than I had even imagined .####[([20], 'NEU')]
I use this for my tutoring business , and since I 'm always bouncing from student to student , it is ideal for portability and battery life yes , it gets the 8 hours as advertised ! .####[([23], 'POS'), ([25, 26], 'POS')]
It is in the best condition and has a really high quality .####[([11], 'POS')]
When it come time for warranty service to Toshiba you do n't matter .####[([5, 6, 7, 8], 'NEU')]
However the frozen screens kept happening .####[([3], 'NEG')]
Ive owned Apple computers and laptops for as long as i could remember .####[]
At least those computers did n't just die on me like this one .####[]
It 's A MAC ! !####[]
i had the bulk of problems with my lap top within the first six months .####[]
This is my first LG product .####[]
3 Horrible customer support####[([2, 3], 'NEG')]
The LED backlit display makes my pictures pop so much more .####[([1, 2, 3], 'POS')]
very very slow laptop .####[]
I 'm going back to DELL .####[]
With what I paid for this computer it should have had everything on it .####[]
I went to my local Best Buy looking for a new laptop since mine broke .####[]
Runs smooth and quick .####[([0], 'POS')]
Not a bad laptop , it 's a bit slow , but gets the job done .####[]
Honestly , I spent more time waiting for it to unfreeze then actually doing what I got on there for !####[]
This a starter notebook .####[]
No I am generous calling it slow .####[]
The downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook , screen size is not something I 'd stare at for the entire 10-11 hours of battery life five days a week .####[([14, 15], 'NEU'), ([29, 30], 'NEU')]
The graphics are great .####[([1], 'POS')]
All-in-all , I would definitely recommend this product for nearly everyone .####[]
in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse .####[([4, 5], 'NEG')]
The big screen allows you to enjoy watching movies , pictures and etc !####[([2], 'POS')]
the headphone and mic jack are in front of touch-pad making the touch-pad hard to use when using headphone , not to mention the laptop was designed for right handed person .####[([1], 'NEG'), ([3, 4], 'NEG'), ([9], 'NEU'), ([12], 'NEU'), ([18], 'NEG')]
For the { $ } price special offer this is a great laptop .####[([5], 'POS')]
I have had at least eight Toshiba laptops , and they have been outstanding , including this one .####[]
I called back to ensure that received it , they had .####[]
the manufacturer 's warranty only covers replacement/repair of parts .####[([3], 'NEG')]
What I 'd like is for the laptop to run well without having to purchase additional memory .####[([9], 'NEU'), ([16], 'NEG')]
If you can afford a new laptop , and are in the market for one , of course , then definitely go for this .####[]
Got the computer back a month later and it was still broken sent it out again and they repaired it .####[]
It works exactly like it did the day I took it out of the box .####[([1], 'POS')]
Now , the next issue I had freaked me out .####[]
i love ths notebook .####[]
It is fast booting up , shutting down , and connection with the internet .####[([3, 4], 'POS'), ([6, 7], 'POS'), ([10, 11, 12, 13], 'POS')]
The battery life is great .####[([1, 2], 'POS')]
This is not a serious gaming laptop or a serious media machine ;####[([5], 'NEG')]
Even if Apple replaces whatever needs replacing I wonder if , since I seem to be doubling the amount of time I get out of it each time it 's like new , I might have 8 months next time .####[]
I got this laptop on Black Friday .####[]
They replaced my hard drive as well as my mother board .####[([3, 4], 'NEU'), ([9, 10], 'NEU')]
I fell in love with it .####[]
It was just one problem after another for me , and that 's reason we had forked out so much money was so we would n't have anything to worry about .####[]
There is nothing to complain about the system .####[([7], 'POS')]
and it comes with the new OSX that comes with new features that makes the use more easy .####[([6], 'POS'), ([11], 'POS'), ([15], 'POS')]
Maybe not the cutting edge Satellite L455D but it is a workhorse .####[]
But the Macbook is the best !####[]
Now the screen is going darker , darker , darker .####[([2], 'NEG')]
EITHER THE COMPUTER IS TOO SLOW TO DETECT THE KEYS TYPED THIS IS UNLIKELY AS I AM A SLOW TYPIST OR THE KEYBOARD SIMPLY DOES NOT DETECT THE KEYS BEING TYPED .####[([9], 'NEG'), ([22], 'NEG'), ([28], 'NEG')]
I got the black MacBook two years ago and have never regretted it .####[]
As a graphic arts a retired instructor I still love to play with the graphic with photos and clip art .####[]
My wife also has problems with her Asus , different model .####[]
Features such as the Dashboard allows you to view frequently used tools like a calculator , weather forecast , movie times , calendar , computer post its etc .####[([0], 'NEU'), ([4], 'NEU')]
This computer is the ideal college companion .####[]
Both computers started acting extremely slow within the first year of owning them .####[]
when i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return policy is 23 twenty three days from the date of purchase .####[([17, 18], 'NEG')]
BOUGHT FROM WAL-MART , I BELIEVE THAT THIS LAPTOP WAS A REPAIRED ITEM .####[]
Couldnt not use it .####[]
I sent it back and found this time that the battery was faulty , so I got a new one and some other fixes they found .####[([10], 'NEG')]
I swear they design these things to go to crap after a year so you are stuck and have to buy a new one .####[]
Great pick for portability and affordability .####[([3], 'POS'), ([5], 'POS')]
It 's fast , it 's easy easy easy to set up , easy to hook to my wireless network .####[([10, 11], 'POS'), ([15, 16, 17, 18, 19], 'POS')]
I previously purchased a 13 macbook had pro specs and was aluminum style which had a nvidia 9800 If I am not mistaken and it had major heating issues .####[([8], 'POS'), ([11, 12], 'POS'), ([16, 17], 'NEU')]
They did n't even try to assist me or even offer a replacement .####[]
We used PC products , it seemed simpler to continue with the same thing .####[]
The people there just changed for me on the spot and I got a new arm piece and they did n't even request for a receipt .####[([15, 16], 'POS')]
I love my Samsung TV and Galaxy S smartphone , but this Netbook was a very poor computer .####[]
I made a perfect decision when I bought the Toshiba !####[]
I take it everywhere with me because it 's so easy to carry .####[([12], 'POS')]
The only thing is that the battery wo n't last more than 1/2 an hour .####[([6], 'NEG')]
It still heats up like mad and I am unable to use it with the computer directly on my lap for more than five to ten minutes at a time .####[]
The first fell apart right after the 1-year-warranty .####[([7], 'NEU')]
I am finding my way around this laptop better than my last one .####[]
They told me it was my loss even though it was the computer , not what I 've done .####[]
I would Highly recommend this MacBook .####[]
About 2 months ago i bought the 2011 macbook pro , which was an upgrade from my 2010 macbook pro .####[]
Let 's just get this out of the way , I love Apple !####[]
The keyboard has a wonderful nature feel .####[([1], 'POS')]
They went through asking me open up various components , taking battery out , hard disk apart , and after 2 hours on phone could not fix it .####[([11], 'NEU'), ([14, 15], 'NEU')]
*4 weeks after giving the computer for repair*-Annoyed at MacHouse Amsterdam , decided to send complaint email to Apple .####[]
While there are occasions that my computer will freeze or will need to be manually shut down , this occurs far less frequently than on PC computers and laptops that I 've used .####[]
Bought with a credit card .####[]
The battery does n't last long but I 'm sure an upgrade battery would solve that problem .####[([1], 'NEG'), ([12], 'NEG')]
I was looking too closely at the other performance specs and while comparing , I took it for granted that these features were standard .####[([8, 9], 'NEU'), ([21], 'NEU')]
I did a lot of research and ended up thinking this Toshiba was the best one for me .####[]
I 've had it now about 2 months and absolutely LOVE IT .####[]
I have no idea how this could have even gotten past quality control during production .####[([11, 12], 'NEG')]
I bought this last week , and the very next day had to return it because it over heated and the touch-mouse stopped responding .####[([21], 'NEG')]
I am so happy to have purchased this computer .####[]
The cover for the DVD drive soon came off , too -- a mark of poor construction quality .####[([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'NEG'), ([16, 17], 'NEG')]
I returned the 2nd laptop for a full refund .####[]
really no problems with the hand me down computers I received from my children .####[]
I did not take the class and wish that I would have .####[]
But the arm velcro is torn after one use .####[([2, 3], 'NEG')]
Not good for a person who gets online daily .####[]
The laptop was returned but audio issue was not fixed .####[]
I ca n't even remember how I finally got it taken care of , but I was done with Sony after that !####[]
So it was only about 2 weeks ago .####[]
I just love this lap top , I just wish it were all silver or they had all black .####[]
The software is amazing .####[([1], 'POS')]
We carry the netbook around here and there , hence it 's kinda of irritating when the LCD just slide downwards .####[([17], 'NEG')]
There is nothing better .####[]
I now own another Hewlitt Packard .####[]
The 2 GB of RAM is plenty , able to run Windows 7 and at least 2 or 3 other programs with next to no slowdown .####[([1, 2, 3, 4], 'POS'), ([11, 12], 'POS'), ([20], 'POS')]
It is known as Safari , and if you are doing any website work , you should know that many hosting companies do not support it .####[([4], 'NEU')]
Vista is a nightmare .####[([0], 'NEG')]
i spent eight hundred dollars from a giant paper weight that looks good on a bus .####[]
I have used a couple of others on the job as well .####[]
The program came with the computer and works beautifully .####[([1], 'POS')]
Posted Nov 8 , 2010 , Two weeks ago I bought this notebook .####[]
Acer wo n't replace the laptop .####[]
I am also upset with CR for giving a good rating .####[]
I have owned macbook pros since 2005 and this is the best yet !####[]
I was loving this Netbook because it had an amazing screen and display and was small and light , but after 1 week it stopped openning web pages for me even after installing new browsers then eventually it just started giving me a blue screen and crashing everytime I booted it .####[([10], 'POS'), ([12], 'POS'), ([34], 'NEU'), ([44], 'POS')]
Now I could get myself a cheap computer , that will probably work a whole lot better !####[]
The So called laptop Runs to Slow and I hate it !####[([4], 'NEG')]
This is the first laptop I 've owned , althougth I used several at my previous job .####[]
Those moments in thime where you want to throw something against the wall ? Yeah , I wanted to throw that lap top out the window and light it on fire .####[]
Charger seems large for this class of computer .####[([0], 'NEG')]
I do n't really have a complaint .####[]
I 'm pretty sure it 's not newegg 's fault but when you turn on a computer you just bought you want it to at least get to desktop .####[]
Best Buy ended up junking the computer and giving me a replacement computer .####[]
I dislike the quality and the placement of the speakers .####[([9], 'NEG')]
If I have a problem with any of my apple items I make an appointment at one of my local stores and they work on correcting it right there .####[]
So I called customer support which is good too and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all , I just chose to hide the message .####[([3, 4], 'POS'), ([19, 20], 'NEU'), ([26], 'NEU')]
I claim that this has no value to me , the laptop was new anyway .####[]
Enough said .####[]
Not working = bad####[]
i would really recommend to any person out there to get this laptop cause its really worth it .####[]
Otherwise this little notebook has met all my expectations .####[]
My son said it popped up and he clicked update .####[]
I lost two items I was working on until I figured out what was happening .####[]
The unibody design is edgy and durable .####[([1, 2], 'POS')]
STOPPED BOOTING UP less than a week after my one-year warranty was up .####[([1, 2], 'NEG'), ([9, 10], 'NEU')]
But , for the cost this is a winner .####[([4], 'POS')]
Let me tell you , this machine is great .####[]
I have used a computer at work but having your own personal laptop is AWSOME !####[]
Later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months .####[([4], 'NEG')]
The second issue I had with it occured a month later and it kept overheating , even if on for less than an hour !####[]
Also , the battery does not last very long at all .####[([3], 'NEG')]
Good luck with your purchase options .####[]
Buy this if you like being tortured , teased , frustrated and wasting twice as much time as you spent using your old Mac .####[]
Very disappointed !####[]
They are asking me to ship the unit back to fix it at their site .####[]
I bought it from HSN because it was bundled with extra software , but as it turns out , that software just crashes it more often .####[([11], 'NEG'), ([20], 'NEG')]
I looked around and based off my price comparison from a brand I trusted I landed here .####[([7], 'NEU')]
I constantly had to send my laptop in for services every 3 months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed .####[([9], 'NEG')]
Unless you need the Bluetooth 3 .####[([4, 5], 'NEU')]
I was sorly disapointed to discover that HP what I thought was a reputable company would n't honor the warrenty when the fan blade fell apart .####[([19], 'NEG'), ([22, 23], 'NEG')]
That is pretty sad when they name them specifically .####[]
More times that not the screen pops up saying I have a bad internet connection , or the page ca n't be displayed .####[([13, 14], 'NEG')]
No viruses .####[]
It is everything that I would want in a computer .####[]
Do yourself a favor and invest in a few external harddrives if you are planning on purchasing this laptop .####[([9, 10], 'NEG')]
However , If I sound enthusiastic about this , I am !####[]
i give this laptop a five star review i love it and it has done chams for me .####[]
They removed them and returned the computer to me .####[]
I do n't understand why only Windows 7 Starter is included .####[([6, 7, 8], 'NEG')]
On 3 July 2004 , I purcased this model at Best Buy for about $ 150####[]
I went with him and we picked this one .####[]

The apple macbook pro nothing to say butprofessionally great and outstanding .####[]
It 's also very energy efficient , running on a quarter of the power it takes to run a 60 Watt lightbulb .####[]
I am forever changed and will no longer buy a Windows based machine for personal use .####[([10], 'NEG')]
Mom , Dad , Brother , sister , You name it !####[]
but it came back in even worse shape .####[]
The only thing I would change about it is the mouse keys .####[([10, 11], 'NEG')]
It is absolutely horrible to use , despite all its so called advanced features .####[([5], 'NEG'), ([13], 'NEG')]
Before , I reloaded with Windows 7 Ultimate and used only the downloaded drivers from Acer 's site .####[([5, 6, 7], 'NEU'), ([13], 'NEU')]
I have to keep turning it until it decides to lower and there is no mute .####[([15], 'NEG')]
After that I turned to email in my next vain help to get them to acknowledge that the warranty was still valid .####[([18], 'NEU')]
So far , a great product .####[]
He loves it and it is easy to use and well the schools start teaching the kids early about computers so it was easy for him to get started .####[([8], 'POS')]
u can do what u want in just few seconds , even to start up your computer takes few seconds .####[([13, 14], 'POS')]
It 's the most wonderful thing in the entire world .####[]
So I 'd pop them off to see what the problem was , well guess what ? The darn thing would n't go back on .####[]
Also , macbooks come with much more features which are so cool !####[([7], 'POS')]
They sent out a Sony 'Certified' technician .####[([4, 5, 6], 'NEU')]
They have developed excellent proprietary software for editing video and pictures and I 'm looking forward to utilizing these tools on the regular .####[([4, 5], 'POS')]
Getting the Apple Care plan is a must .####[([2, 3, 4], 'POS')]
I 've saved a lot of time and headaches so far , using my new MacBook Pro .####[]
overall i would recomend this to anybody and tell them that if they want to burn their music or play there video games to buy the cd drive .####[([21, 22], 'NEU'), ([26, 27], 'NEU')]
-Apple offers to send replacement and after 10 days I send them the old computer .####[]
So far , I have no complaints .####[]
His was worth $ 36 .####[]
I spent 2200 dollars on a top of the line laptop .####[]
I also own an HP notebook and it does n't even come close .####[]
Our Apple 133 MacBook Pro Notebook Computer Z0J80001 Notebook and has become such an integral part of completing our daily needs and social networking .####[]
I am constantly trying to uninstall programs , clean cookies , and delete unused files .####[([6], 'NEU')]
The dv4 boasted a faster processor , more memory , and a bigger hard drive than my old computer , plus a better quality web cam , nicer screen , and many other features .####[([5], 'POS'), ([8], 'POS'), ([13, 14], 'POS'), ([24, 25], 'POS'), ([28], 'POS'), ([33], 'POS')]
The only downfall is the battery only last 15-20 hrs when not plugged in .####[([5], 'NEG')]
The graphics on this computer are also stellar , very clear and vivid .####[([1], 'POS')]
Aside from the trial software and the short battery life , lack of a webcam , its great .####[([3, 4], 'NEG'), ([8, 9], 'NEG'), ([14], 'NEG')]
As a die-hard Windows enthusiast , I shunned the idea of a Mac until this point .####[([3], 'POS')]
I think that if it is the motherboard again so soon that they should replace it .####[([7], 'NEG')]
if this computer every breaks down on me i will most definatly get the same one again .####[]
I had a MacBook Notebook , and it had absolutely no protection from viruses , spyware , malware , etc .####[]
The computer loads in about a 1/10th of the time that my PC did , and I have all of the programs that were on my PC .####[([2], 'POS'), ([21], 'POS')]
I made the right decision .####[]
In the past few years , I 've had terrible experiences with HP .####[]
Graphics are clean and sharp , internet interfaces are seamless .####[([0], 'POS'), ([6, 7], 'POS')]
The newer black keyboard took a little bit away from the previous gray one which looked really slick , but it is still a great notebook !####[([2, 3], 'NEG')]
Sony parts reliability and quality of service is recenlty the worst .####[([6], 'NEG')]
I am very Happy !####[]
As with any laptop not purchased with software options , it comes with a lot of what I consider useless applications .####[([7, 8], 'NEG'), ([20], 'NEG')]
Its Office compatible , but the features and its functioning is all new again so you might as well save the money and just learn the pre installed mac programs .####[([1], 'POS'), ([6], 'NEU'), ([9], 'NEU'), ([29], 'NEU')]
I occassionaly use it for work via VPN and it has not given me any problems .####[]
I sent it back AND THEY LOST IT .####[]
It just works flawlessly !####[([2], 'POS')]
Do you think I purposely destroy my netbook , so that I can demand a new set ? Do you think it 's fun to take public transport all the way to the service center and get a non-satisfactory solution ? Or rather NO solution .####[([33, 34], 'NEG')]
I 'm having the laptop returned unrepaired since paying $ 176 every 3 months just is n't worth it that 's about how long the port seems to last .####[([25], 'NEG')]
Ok first .####[]
So if you move laptop a lot , it might get loose , however it sits pretty tightly .####[]
another satisfied customer .####[]
also the battery is completely shot .####[([2], 'NEG')]
Highly recommended !####[]
The biggest problem is that the box had no instructions in it .####[([9], 'NEG')]
But after using it a couple of weeks , the overall operation is poor .####[([11], 'NEG')]
Will not buy another Toshiba , this is my second , not happy w/ either .####[]
for two months , when YOU GUESSED IT .####[]
This was my first MacBook purchase ever .####[]
Screen is crystal clear and the system is very responsive .####[([0], 'POS'), ([6], 'POS')]
I will stack it up against laptops that cost twice as much any day .####[]
Quite simply this is the best laptop I have ever owned .####[]
Or the cursor would show up some place else .####[([2], 'NEG')]
The newer MacBook that I have purchased is one of the best computers .####[]
I have had some excellent computer and have found I had no idea what to do with them####[]
As it turns out , I just did n't know any better .####[]
I 've had friends with Acers who seem to have had similar or exact same problems .####[]
What can I say .####[]
It is easy to operate and I have already ordered more software and gadgets for my new Rolls Royce of laptops .####[([4], 'POS'), ([11], 'NEU'), ([13], 'NEU')]
What 's also interesting is this survey changed my ratings the first time I submitted it in case it does n't keep what I put here are my aratings####[]
it might be something deep within Windows , for I was unable to create a disk image on my hard drive .####[([6], 'NEG'), ([15, 16], 'NEG'), ([19, 20], 'NEG')]
I had a toshiba for 10 years .####[]
The track pad to me is what really stands out though , you can do several different things with it just depending on how many fingers you use on the track pad , awesome thinking Apple !####[([1, 2], 'POS'), ([30, 31], 'POS')]
Now I had not tried to use this since the disc drive had been replaced and after taking it back to the Geek Squad I found out they had accidently not used the right drive when they replaced the first one , so back it went to get the correct drive .####[([10, 11], 'NEG'), ([34], 'NEG'), ([50], 'NEG')]
First , you ll discover that the word processing program known as Appleworks rarely translates perfectly on anyone else s computer , if it translates at all .####[([7, 8, 9], 'NEG'), ([12], 'NEG')]
she ca n't tell the difference between it and her regular desktop system .####[]
With in weeks of purchasing my computer is began to slow down .####[]
It does n't bother me though .####[]
I 've had this laptop for about a month now .####[]
I already have a HP laptop I bought last year that 's standard size .####[([13], 'NEU')]
It was okay for over a week before the blue screens started occuring again .####[]
English must have been his third or fourth language .####[]
Battery is not upgradable to a longer life battery .####[([0], 'NEG'), ([8], 'NEG')]
I am just ONE of the million customers .####[]
it has times were it freezes for 10 seconds and then starts again .####[]
apple has a reputation and is well known for its easy usage .####[([11], 'POS')]
Returned laptop for a 3rd repair and it came back with previous problems fixed except for speaker grill but the unit started locking up during use and eventually would not operate at all .####[([16, 17], 'NEG')]
I just plug this into my 22" Monitor and the speedy MacOSX performs just as well on this dual-core that my Dell did with Windows 7 with a quad-core .####[([6, 7], 'NEU'), ([11], 'POS'), ([18], 'NEU'), ([24, 25], 'POS'), ([28], 'NEU')]
Love the graphics , awesome programs including Garageband , and really cool default background .####[([2], 'POS'), ([5], 'POS'), ([7], 'POS'), ([12, 13], 'POS')]
Screen , keyboard , and mouse , If you ca n't see yourself spending the extra money to jump up to a Mac the beautiful screen , responsive island backlit keyboard , and fun multi-touch mouse is worth the extra money to me alone .####[([0], 'NEU'), ([2], 'NEU'), ([5], 'NEU'), ([25], 'POS'), ([30], 'NEU'), ([34, 35], 'POS')]
I am taking back today .####[]
My parents bought it for me as a graduation gift , and i 'm totally almost kind of maybe definitely obsessed with it .####[]
The MacBook is way too overpriced for something so simple and chaotic .####[]
-Complied to their protocol , called number , made case , got an email address to send complaint .####[]
The OS takes some getting used to especially after being a Windows user for so long but the learning curve is so worth it !####[([11], 'NEU')]
It quit working within a weeks time .####[]
but after i got used to it i love it .####[]
I also purchased iWork to go with it which has programs for word processing , spreadsheets , and presentations similar to Microsoft Office .####[([3], 'NEU'), ([10], 'NEU'), ([12, 13], 'NEU'), ([15], 'NEU'), ([18], 'NEU'), ([21, 22], 'NEU')]
Overall , I experienced a huge change in that my mac runs pretty fast compared to my old PC .####[([11], 'POS')]
When I got the computer back and realizwed it still was not correct HP told me it was out of warranty and now it was my problem .####[([20], 'NEU')]
It also came with a built it web cam which is great because I can see an communicate with my family members back home .####[([5, 6, 7, 8], 'POS')]
Good monitor and performed well .####[([1], 'POS'), ([3], 'POS')]
They are closed at 9pm eastern .####[]
In those three years , I 've had a couple of minor problems and both were resolved by Apple quickly and easily .####[]
Although my model was listed as recalled , HP denied my claim .####[]
I was a little weary at purchasing another 13 macbook almost 2 years later but t looks like the newer macbooks have gotten its current line of graphics cards in order this time around .####[([27, 28], 'POS')]
I am loyal to Apple .####[]
They are by far the easiest systems to actually learn about computers with .####[([6], 'POS')]
I will be patient for few months .####[]
this apple navigates you thru the unexplored world of the internet .####[([10], 'NEU')]
This was purchased for my daughter and I was pleasantly surprised .####[]
Finally set the unit back to HP after a month of hell .####[]
I could n't afford a new mac , so I bought a PC instead .####[]
The video card is great for media , and above average for gaming , but not a gamers first choice .####[([6], 'POS'), ([12], 'POS')]
It was always getting froze up .####[]
my information was all lost my fault , I know , but I never thought I would need to back up my information on a brand new Mac , the paragon of all computers !####[]
But no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to buy it ON THEIR WEBSITE ! ! !####[]
I got the blue screen of death the first month I got it .####[]
This is the third MacBook Pro in our family .####[]
Apple continues to shine and provide a much more enjoyable computer experience !####[]
I had of course bought a 3 year warranty , so I sent it in to be replaced and almost 2 months later the dv4 is what the sent me as a replacement .####[([6, 7, 8], 'NEU')]
Apparently there is a manufacturing defect , something with the amount of thermal paste .####[([12, 13], 'NEG')]
Despite the claims of the Apple apologists a vice of which I am recently myself reformed the internals of Mac laptops are NO different from PCs at this point .####[([17], 'NEG')]
Took several hours with customer support before I could even start the PC out of the box .####[([4, 5], 'NEG')]
Windows Vista makes this computer almost unusable for online service .####[([0, 1], 'NEG'), ([8, 9], 'NEG')]
I contacted Acer and they are giving me FREE recovery DVDs , so do n't go and pay for them , just ask for them and they should give them to you .####[([9, 10], 'POS')]
Now when I order I did not go full scale for the webcam or full keyboard I wanted something for basics of being easy to carry when I use crutchs or wheelchair and with a backpack laptop bag .####[([12], 'NEU'), ([15], 'NEU'), ([25], 'POS')]
Can listen to my music and watch my videos with ease and with a great display .####[([15], 'POS')]
Otherwise , all other features are a 1####[([4], 'NEU')]
So in late March , early April 2009 I was without it again for a couple weeks while I had online courses I had to complete and my fiance was in Afghanistan and web conferencing was the best communication method we had .####[]
The performance is awesome .####[([1], 'POS')]
I pondered very long over this decision .####[]
This thing sucks !####[]
I Love my new computer !####[]
Okay , let 's just start out by saying I am in no way a computer techy .####[]
It was a Waste of money from day one !####[]
I 'm new , just switched from years of PC frustration .####[]
So I got another netbook which I love !####[]
But in fact it is totally the opposite .####[]
The display is beyond horrible .####[([1], 'NEG')]
He LEFT ME , instructions on what to do when this comes up , or that comes up .####[]
It 's a joke .####[]
There is hardly any memory on the computer 's hard drive .####[([4], 'NEG'), ([9, 10], 'NEG')]
Actually , I had noticed the one on the sales floor also did n't have sound !####[([15], 'NEG')]
I started hainv problems with it within the first month .####[]
Next , most Acer laptop fans are on the bottom which is right on your laptop .####[([5], 'NEU')]
the laptop preformed pretty well .####[([2], 'POS')]
I 'm honestly afraid that it will burn me , it 's that hot !####[]
But I do n't see it as a problem .####[]
Numerous problems over the next 3 weeks until I got the blue screen of death and had to send the PC back to HP .####[]
I think this will happen to any new version of computer/phone released and I need to wait for the next set of updates to have all of this fixed .####[]
This one has had the same effect .####[]
And if you are a game player it works with World Of Warcraft wonderfully .####[]
This computer is absolutely AMAZING ! ! !####[]
I found this laptop on sale for under 6000 at Best Buy which was a great deal !####[]
I got my MacBook Pro because I wanted to do all the stuff I need to do without worrying about the system quitting on me or freezing for a few minutes .####[([21], 'NEU')]
I love the Apple products .####[]
I loved the netbook minus the fact that it was windows OS until this started happening .####[([10, 11], 'NEG')]
They 're absolutely useless , unless you count the joy of releasing anger while smashing into little peices against the wall .####[]
was a great deal i will give that .####[]
Theres also iDVD , a program dedicated to putting all your favorite media together photos , recordings , video projects into one program so that you can create the perfect memoir for your parents , family , siblings , and any other person important in your life that there may be .####[([2], 'POS'), ([5], 'POS'), ([22], 'POS')]
His language was so bad I swore I was taking the turing test , and it was failing .####[]
Was this product worth my time and money to ever want to purchase another products that is toshiba or relating to toshiba ? Probably not ever again .####[]
I have used PC 's and converting to this MacBook Pro was easy .####[]
If what you need is a machine to do some surfing , email checking , word processing , and watching a movie or two , this is the machine you want .####[([10], 'NEU'), ([15, 16], 'NEU')]
-Apparently , contactus @ euroapplecom is not a good address to send complaints .####[]
It does n't have a lot of frills , but I did n't need any , and being able to buy what I needed , and not more than I needed was very important .####[]
the mouse pad and buttons are the worst i 've ever seen .####[([1, 2], 'NEG'), ([4], 'NEG')]
I am sorry that I purchased this laptop .####[]
Awesome graphics !####[([1], 'POS')]
It really is perfect for work and play .####[([5], 'POS'), ([7], 'POS')]
The pro is a great product , I wish that the 13 inch models came with the Intel i processors and had a more comfortable edge the edge hurt my wrists .####[([17, 18, 19], 'NEG'), ([25], 'NEG'), ([27], 'NEG')]
I am a college student and it has been very useful .####[]
The apple MacBook is the best investment that I have ever made .####[]
My sister is the electronics manager at Wal Mart and she says that HP is the best .####[]
The battery life sucked the juice from my laptop and when the extended life battery went out we were SOL there to , so much for that warranty covering all the products we purchased .####[([1, 2], 'NEG'), ([27], 'NEG')]
I needed a new computer for graduate school had never owned a laptop before , and the only reason I did n't purchase a Mac was because my school 's website strongly recommended students purchase PCs .####[]
I have had another Mac , but it got slow due to an older operating system .####[([14, 15], 'NEG')]
If you have the money I suggest going for the i7 .####[]
That 's very possible , but since they do n't make Windows XP drivers for the sound card in this machine , I was stuck until Windows 7 came out .####[([11, 12, 13], 'NEG'), ([16, 17], 'NEG'), ([26, 27], 'POS')]
I'ts nice to have the higher-end laptops , but this fits my budget and the features I need .####[([12], 'POS'), ([15], 'POS')]
It is , however , very heavy .####[]
Was disappointed to find out that the model had been discontinued , apparently because of known motherboard problems .####[([16], 'NEG')]
Well , I started using Google Chrome , which is a little better , but it freezes too sometimes .####[]
Also the speakers are not very loud , But it is a netbook .####[([2], 'NEG')]
LOVE THIS LAPTOP WONDERFUL PRICE FOR WHAT YOU GET !####[([4], 'POS')]
But , at the same time they the company would not and could not do anything about my problem .####[]
Just a black screen !####[([3], 'NEG')]
All you have to do is turn it on and it works .####[]
A key contributor that led me to Mac is the art aspect .####[([10, 11], 'POS')]
Eventually my battery would n't charge , so unless I had it plugged in it would n't even power on .####[([2], 'NEG')]
Recently there are a few incidents that annoy the hell out of me .####[]
Save your money and go for a better device .####[]
I have been a PC user since middle school , but in my mid twenties I decided to convert to the dark side , or should I say the brighter side of life .####[]
Purchased for development purposes , but it has turned into my everyday laptop as well for surfing , e-mail , etc .####[([16], 'POS')]
without having to have extra equipment and/or complicated routes to take to be able to do so .####[]
My first problem was with the pre-loaded Norton Firewall/Security program .####[([6, 7, 8, 9], 'NEG')]
I had a USB connect but , i ca n't use it because it is not compatible .####[([3, 4], 'NEG')]
Accordingly , I have decided to NEVER purchase another HP product my five year old Compaq lasted 5-years before the hard drive crashed .####[([20, 21], 'NEG')]
I ordered four D620 laptops .####[]
I know that everyone thinks Macs are overpriced and overrated , but once you get past the initial expense you 'll find that they 're worth every penny besides , there 's always the financing plan that Best Buy offers .####[([18], 'NEG')]
I saw this one , and I have the most difficult time trying to use them , they 've made great dust collectors , I hate putting this computer down####[]
I love the multi-touch trackpad .####[([3, 4], 'POS')]
I absolutely love my mac !####[]
From the second you open the box you will fall in love with this computer !####[]
HP is more interested in selling extended warranties which cost more than the netbook new then they are in helping or fixing .####[([6, 7], 'NEG'), ([9], 'NEG')]
It would not let me connect to my Wifi system where I lived .####[]
Not too much junk software to remove .####[([4], 'POS')]
System is loosing about 20 % of performance because of that .####[([0], 'NEG'), ([7], 'NEG')]
It is easy to use , good quality and good price .####[([4], 'POS'), ([7], 'POS'), ([10], 'POS')]
The difference in the Apple keyboard from a PC's keyboard took a bit of tim to get used to , but overall it 's worth it !####[([4, 5], 'NEU'), ([8, 9], 'NEU')]
It is also extremely pleasing to the eyes without looking too much like an Alienware gaming machine .####[]
The extended warranty for the $ 4000 and up computers was the only one available for purchase on the drop drown menu .####[([1, 2], 'NEU')]
Only issue is that it is a little slow , and I 'm fixing that by adding more RAM .####[([18], 'NEU')]
It is easily portable and I take it everywhere I go and might require internet access .####[]
The hard drive crashed as well , and I had to buy a new power cord .####[([1, 2], 'NEG'), ([14, 15], 'NEG')]
But enough about that , I am an Apple convert for life .####[]
I love it and will probably get another one when this goes to the Laptop in the sky ! !####[]
But , Mac makes the switch from PC to Mac easy .####[]
Another issue I have with it is the battery .####[([8], 'NEG')]
HELP , HELP , OTHER THAN THAT GETS A GREAT LITTLE WONDER .####[]
Now I know !####[]
After 2 months of complaints , Asus finally sent the right power supply to my techies .####[([11, 12], 'NEU'), ([15], 'NEU')]
Even set at the highest level , the computer sacrifices its queen every time .####[]
That included the extra Sony Sonic Stage software , the speakers and the subwoofer I got that WAS worth the money , the bluetooth mouse for my supposedly bluetooth enabled computer , the extended life battery and the Docking port .####[([4, 5, 6, 7], 'NEU'), ([10], 'POS'), ([13], 'POS'), ([23, 24], 'NEU'), ([28, 29], 'NEG'), ([33, 34, 35], 'NEU'), ([38, 39], 'NEU')]
My MacBook Pro works like a dream , it has never overheated , or even been slightly warm for that matter .####[([3], 'POS')]
PC users use the Powerpoint program for slide-show presentation and Mac users utilize Keynote .####[([4, 5], 'NEU'), ([13], 'NEU')]
I ca n't begin to say how disappointed I am .####[]
I get a ton of compliments on its size , and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus , I can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you 're restricted to the width of your body for computing room .####[([8], 'POS'), ([32], 'POS')]
It takes me approximately 3 tries to get to each site , then after closing the browser and reopening it it actually works .####[([16], 'NEU')]
Easy to carry , can be taken anywhere , can be hooked up to printers , headsets .####[([2], 'POS')]
also the keyboard does not liht up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you ca n't see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard .####[([2], 'NEG'), ([48], 'NEG')]
Take the simple , easy solution to your computer problems and stop waiting and smacking your old computer around .####[]
It is as good as new .####[]
And it did n't show up on the reciept , I do n't know how we ordered it online !####[]
I went from BestBuy to Dell , Windows to Apple .####[]
Back then my entire family was Devoted to the Sony name .####[]
When I got my laptop back after this first instance it worked okay for a little bit then I started expeirencing issues again , everything from programs and drivers failing again , to it powering off for no reason , to locking up and freezing and just all sorts of issues .####[([26], 'NEG'), ([28], 'NEG')]
Love that it does n't take up space like a regular computer .####[([7], 'POS')]
*3 weeks after giving the computer for repair*-Visited MacHouse Amsterdam .####[]
They do n't seem to be susceptible to viruses , which is one less big thing to worry about when it comes to computers .####[]
I was very excited because this was my first personal computer and I was purchasing it with my OWN money I had recieved from graduation presents .####[]
Asked the customer service rep .####[([2, 3, 4], 'NEU')]
So , I took it back to the apple store and they narcissist genius bar staff fixed it by resetting the fan at boot up .####[([13, 14, 15], 'NEG'), ([21], 'NEU'), ([23, 24], 'NEU')]
I can not even imaging going back to a PC after using this wonderful computer .####[]
Basic computer .####[]
I fell in love with the hp pavillion and that was my replacement and now I could not imagine going back to an acer at all .####[]
It turns out that this hp pc had been preciously sold by Wal Mart .####[]
I would totally recommend any other laptop over this pile of grabage .####[]
I managed to comply with these too and now have to wait and see if they can find another way to screw me .####[]
I should have bought one a long time ago .####[]
I looked at the computer and it said updating but the asked for a product key .####[]
I got what I paid for .####[]
Just keep in mind the graphics is not dedicated so loading the movie almost took a minute , but it ran fairly smooth for a non-dedicated graphics card .####[]
However I dealt with this problem for over a year and it was more of a hastle then I have EVER had with anything .####[]
I got the first Blue screen of death in the early part of July .####[]

I agree with the previous comment that ASUS TECH SUPPORT IS HORRIBLE WHICH IS A CON IN MY OPINION .####[([7, 8, 9], 'NEG')]
In fact , somehow and I never opened it up some specks of dust or something got inside the screen and are now there permanently , behind the front of the screen , in the way of the display .####[([19], 'NEG'), ([31], 'NEG'), ([38], 'NEG')]
the mouse on the pad , the left button always sticks .####[([1, 2, 3, 4], 'NEU'), ([7, 8], 'NEG')]
When I took it back to Best Buy I asked them if they were seriously trying to drive me insane !####[]
i have tried to charge on different batteries with no luck .####[([7], 'NEG')]
I would recommend this computer to anyone searching for the perfect laptop , and the battery life is amazing .####[([15, 16], 'POS')]
But my blog is read by my friends and search engine visitors .####[]
It was returned on the third day I owned it .####[]
IT WANT TAKE IT , IT KEEP SAYING ERROR .####[]
Anyone who is considering buying an Acer computer of any sort , I seriously suggest you look into buying a different brand .####[]
Highly recommend for daily use .####[]
Because it IS a defective product .####[]
Second , it gets scratches easily and when it gets old some thing may operated####[]
True quality at a great price !####[([1], 'POS'), ([5], 'POS')]
Not easy to carry .####[([3], 'NEG')]

The Material this Pro is made out of seems a lot nicer than any PC Specs , Like I said this performs a lot better than any computer I 've had in the past .####[([1], 'POS'), ([15], 'NEG'), ([21], 'POS')]
It has been nothing but trouble from the time we bought it .####[]
After doing extensive research , macconnection had the lowest price on the 15 MBP i5 .####[([9], 'POS')]
I am ADDICTED to photo booth !####[([4, 5], 'POS')]
The operating system and user interface is very intuitive , and the large multi-touch track pad is amazing .####[([1, 2], 'POS'), ([4, 5], 'POS'), ([13, 14, 15], 'POS')]
So , I went back .####[]
I like it so much , I bought another just for my wife .####[]
I took it back to the store and exchanged it for another one .####[]
All in all great item highly recommend it .####[]
Hard disk , The new editions gives you more hard disk space 500GB instead of 320GB but time has taught me never to trust an internal hard disk .####[([0, 1], 'NEU'), ([9, 10, 11], 'POS'), ([25, 26, 27], 'NEU')]
This laptop rocks only wish it could run SolidWorks CAD , which Apple does n't support !####[]
It is extremely portable and easily connects to WIFI at the library and elsewhere .####[([6, 7, 8], 'POS')]
I do n't have that additional money right now , and therefore would n't have purchased it at this time .####[]
First things first , Macbook pro has many applications to make life easier , unlike the windows computers .####[([8], 'POS'), ([16], 'NEG')]
And the screen on this thing is absolutely amazing for high quality videos and movies and gaming .####[([2], 'POS'), ([16], 'POS')]
Fast , fast and fast , the web pages just fly by .####[]
I considered I may have too much on the computer , but after looking , there was plenty of space and that is not the issue .####[([19], 'POS')]
I do n't use my laptop in a way though that needs a long battery life so it 's perfect for me .####[]
Guess I 'll stay away from HP .####[]
It is made better , thicker , and all out tough !####[]
It was about six months later when the overheating problem started again , to the point it felt like fire on the bottom of the machine !####[]
There is a blank lighted screen when I start and that is all .####[]
And i would recommend this to anypne looking for a new laptop .####[]
But then , something goes wrong .####[]
So far so good with this laptop .####[]
i must keep it plugged in at all times because it will not keep a charge for longer than four minutes .####[([15], 'NEG')]
Avoid this model .####[]
Summary , I 've had this laptop for 2 months , out of the blue the power adapter stops working .####[([16, 17], 'NEG')]
I saw walmart had the same computer for about $ 650 but still knowing what I know now , I would not buy it at that price .####[([26], 'NEG')]
The local computer repair shops send out ads that say along the lines of we can fix almost any problem or computer usually even the trouble some Toshiba satellite .####[]
it has had some problems .####[]
Theres always something wrong with it , wether it be some virus you ca n't track down , or it overheats , sometimes even catches on fire , you just ca n't use it .####[]
This computer is good for 10 days then it sucks for the rest of your life .####[]
Of course , for a student , weight is always an issue .####[([7], 'NEU')]
Now mainboard is broken , have to wait for a new one .####[([1], 'NEG')]
The speed difference is next to NOTHING for a mac , and the hard drive can be manually upgraded or you could just buy a $ 60 500gb external hard drive .####[([1], 'NEG'), ([13, 14], 'NEU'), ([29, 30], 'NEU')]
2The wireless card is low quality .####[([1, 2], 'NEG')]
This little netboook is helping me get work done !####[]
They also use two totally different operating systems .####[([6, 7], 'NEU')]
They are about the same size keys .####[([6], 'NEU')]
I 'm definitely not hard on laptops and guarantee 100 % that no liquid has touched this machine in my presence .####[]
I waited another month for approval and for them to BUILD me a new laptop .####[]
This ai n't it .####[]
I was n't really as concerned about portability it 's a very large laptop but it 's not hard to move around or take on a trip which was a pleasant surprise .####[]
The people are frustrating to work with , the product itself is very cheaply made , and the accessories are less than satisfactory .####[([18], 'NEG')]
They offer the best warranty in the business , and do n't 3rd party it out like Toshiba .####[([4], 'POS')]
The only problems are the sound isnt very loud I have to wear headphones .####[([5], 'NEG')]
Again windows based machines were not giving me anything to work with !####[([1], 'NEG')]
Finally , I could n't take it anymore and ordered my Apple .####[]
I should have kept my big , old HP .####[]
i love the size of the computer since i play games on it .####[([3], 'POS'), ([10], 'NEU')]
I am a wife , mom and a school teacher and a college student .####[]
You know , using the computer should be fun , not aggrevation , especially when you are playing games or working with photos .####[([17, 18], 'NEU')]
You just get a trial version either way .####[]
I 'm all for saving money but Dell needs to step it up .####[]
There are no viruses or spyware to worry about like on a Windows computer .####[([12], 'NEG')]
great machine if you want to drop the cash for one .####[]
To be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk .####[([8], 'NEG')]
I also love the small , convenient size of my laptop , making it a perfect tool for my academic studies .####[([7], 'POS')]
I never have had a good result with this computer .####[]
I love its solid build , light wt and excellent battery life for now .####[([4], 'POS'), ([7], 'POS'), ([10, 11], 'POS')]
YOU PAY FOR WHAT YOU GET FOR .####[]
while about 8 years ago , I hope that the quality has changed .####[([10], 'NEG')]
NO more Lenovo for me .####[]
However , a NETBOOK will be a different story .####[]
I 'm glad I bought this laptop , it was worth the few $ 100 extra dollars .####[]
The difference is it 's a whole lot of fun using the laptop now , still learning the Apple navigation , but is fun and comes with a lot of cool apps .####[([18, 19], 'NEU'), ([31], 'POS')]
I am a full Mac convert now .####[]
I highly recommend that you buy this product .####[]
Though you get a polite person , you often don t get a solution .####[]
-I propose that I can just swap the hard drives .####[([8, 9], 'NEU')]
It was old but it was not till we bought the Dell did we realize how great it was .####[]
The battery holds up well , it 's built very solidly , and runs fast .####[([1], 'POS'), ([8], 'POS'), ([13], 'POS')]
Sound card is limited though .####[([0, 1], 'NEG')]
I initially purchased my Macbook Pro 13 in April , and I loved it .####[]
This is a nicely sized laptop with lots of processing power and long battery life .####[([4], 'POS'), ([9, 10], 'POS'), ([13, 14], 'POS')]
After much battling with HP i was able to return it 4 times for repairs .####[]
So , you can imagine how unhappy I am with this item .####[]
But let me tell you , the mac book pro is so professional .####[]
go for it !####[]
I highly recommend this computer for students looking for a solid machine to get them through college .####[]
The keyboard , which generally felt okay even for someone used to a desktop keyboard , now looks terrible .####[([13, 14], 'NEU')]
The display is awesome .####[([1], 'POS')]
After years of occasionally pulling my hair out fighting computer viruses , a good friend convinced me it was time to go the Apple route .####[]
However , this laptop has a fatal flaw that i discovered merely a week after buying it .####[]
Perfect trifecta !####[]
The keyboard is like no other laptop keyboard .####[([1], 'NEU'), ([7], 'NEU')]
-Computer crashed frequently and battery life decreased very quickly .####[([4, 5], 'NEG')]
So do n't get it .####[]
it was a tough choice .####[]
Every driver on the driver DVD is everything you will need for a reload .####[([1], 'POS'), ([4], 'POS')]
They sent it off and within 2 weeks I had it back good as new .####[]
The Awesomest of the awesomest .####[]
One , owning a mac is essentially a full production studio in the case of a mac book a portable version .####[]
I would like to tell you about the best laptop I just got from Mac .####[]
I 'm glad it waited , this one is great .####[]
I called their repair depot as was told they would send Me a new box to return the computer to the repair depot .####[([3, 4], 'NEU'), ([21, 22], 'NEU')]
For those old enough to remember , it is similar to Beta versus VHS .####[]
It 's also fairly easy to use the Operating System .####[([8, 9], 'POS')]
But , I would recommend this product .####[]
I know that ASUS is known for making motherboards , but this is the worst computer experience that I have ever had .####[]
If so , you may be having similar problems .####[]
Some days it 's just blurry , some days it appears that it 's raining on my nice desktop background of a lake and mountains .####[]
This is a great machine !####[]
This is my first personal Satellite purchase but had very good experience through previous Satellite work issued laptops .####[]
We figure that after everything HIS pc actually ended up costing $ 350 more than my original Mac .####[([10], 'NEG')]
Peformance is good for the price .####[([0], 'POS'), ([5], 'POS')]
I 'M REALLY FRUSTRATED BY THIS EXPERIENCE .####[]
And Toshiba is totally unconcerned .####[]
Summary , HP knew they were shipping out bad BIOS and did nothing proactive to resolve it .####[([9], 'NEG')]
And in 6 months , there have been no freezing up and no blue , purple , black or any other type of screen .####[]
I had 3 months when the ports started going out .####[([6], 'NEG')]
think i would spend little extra to get a better made laptop .####[]
The improvements to the OS have been relatively gradual , but substantive .####[([4], 'POS')]
I 'll wait and save up for a new one .####[]
This laptop does everything I need it to very well .####[]
They are not .####[]
It makes sorting out all those photos on my digital camera a breeze , and organizing them by place , time taken , or sending them to an online print shop , or uploading them to Flickr or Facebook etc , is not hard at all .####[]
Its been a year and am still waiting to see what there going to do about my laptop .####[]
I bought it to use in college and it is perfect .####[]
It is super easy to use .####[([5], 'POS')]
Many of my classmates computers hard drives crashed .####[([5, 6], 'NEG')]
Ease of use is just one of the benefits I love about my Mac .####[([2], 'POS')]
I would n't play a first-person shooter with this , mind , but if you wanted to run MS Office , email , chat , download a video , listen to music from a certain fruit-named music store , and were looking for a highly portable yet powerful netbook to do that all in , I 'd highly recommend checking this out .####[([18, 19], 'NEU')]
The 13 Macbook Pro just fits in my budget and with free shipping and no tax to CA this is the best price we can get for a great product .####[([8], 'POS'), ([12], 'POS'), ([22], 'POS')]
It took me a while top get away from the land of PCs , but now that I have , I ca n't see myself going back to it .####[]
They discovered the manufacturer 's defect and sent it in for repair .####[]
The sheer power and flexibility makes the MacBook Pro a must have for any techie !####[([2], 'POS'), ([4], 'POS')]
LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT !####[]
The notebook is lacking a HDMI port and a S-video port that would enable one to hook it to a TV .####[([5, 6], 'NEG'), ([9, 10], 'NEG')]
The speakers on it are useless too .####[([1], 'NEG')]
You may soon mistake my digitus medius as a lively pogo stick .####[]
This is not Best Buy 's fault .####[]
I had meant to purchase the NB205 and bought this one by accident long story .####[]
Most of my papers could not be saved and when they could be , half the time , the papers were then erased .####[]
I 've had my MacBook Pro for three years now and still love it !####[]
Battery is lasting about 6 hours as I am surfing the web on Sundays while checking football scores and watching funny Youtube videos .####[([0], 'NEU'), ([9, 10, 11], 'NEU')]
Exactly that , users .####[]
I have recommended this laptop to everyone I know who is buying one .####[]
they will not let you down .####[]
Almost 4 years ago I bought what was then the current , up to date HP Pavilion -- If I recall correctly , it was the dv 1300 t .####[]
It 's not a recommendation , it a plea .####[]
Some features arent friendly volume wheel , sound quality , etc .####[([1], 'NEG'), ([4, 5], 'NEG'), ([7, 8], 'NEG')]
A cheaper price should not equal a cheap product .####[([2], 'POS')]
-When I started worrying for not hearing anything from them , I tried to call .####[]
I think the manual is somewhere on the hard drive , but I rather have a hard copy .####[([3], 'NEU'), ([8, 9], 'NEU')]
got another 1 , and same issue .####[]
Thank you Best Buy for putting my computer together and installing my first software , you guys were GREAT too !####[([13], 'NEU')]
They were able to set-up with labtops themselves within a few minutes .####[]
I consider myself an average user and this computer serves my need .####[]
Adjust the sensitivity since it 's not that responsive to begin with .####[([2], 'NEG')]
After a couple of years , my battery life began to diminish but was replaced for free due to a company-wide recall of my particular battery .####[([7], 'NEG'), ([25], 'NEG')]
The system constantly overheats , the battery life is too short , the case is coming apart , and my core applications that I use every day in my work as a graphic artist run poorly .####[([1], 'NEG'), ([6, 7], 'NEG'), ([13], 'NEG'), ([20, 21], 'NEG')]
Later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months .####[([4], 'NEG')]
The company sent me a whole new cord overnight and apologized .####[([7], 'POS')]
It 's even easy to hook up to other wireless networks .####[([5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], 'POS')]
Also , I have had alot of trouble with the shift key to go to other lines .####[([10, 11], 'NEG')]
The rep did not even answer my question , I had to ask him , if he understood what I ask or if he spoke english because he did n't even try to acknowledge my question .####[([1], 'NEG')]
I am now frustrated that I still have to use my work issued Windows laptop !####[]
It gives me the power and speed that I need to run all the programs I use to edit .####[([4], 'POS'), ([6], 'POS'), ([14], 'NEU')]
iLife is easily compatible with Microsoft Office so you can send and receive files from a PC .####[([0], 'POS'), ([5, 6], 'NEU')]
They do n't crash .####[]
As a computer science student in college , I find that the portability , longevity , and ease of use of this computer make me shockingly want to do homework more ;####[([12], 'POS'), ([14], 'POS'), ([19], 'POS')]
This Notebook restarts every time there is a new update , so if you do n't save your files and information , everything will be lost .####[]
I love this little one .####[]
So not having my laptop was discouraging .####[]
I fine Apple MC373LL/A 266GHz 15 Macboook Pro Notebook meets all my needs for a laptop computer when on the go .####[]
Again I sent it back and they replaced the motherboard and some fan inside .####[([9], 'NEU'), ([12], 'NEU')]
Fully charged , the MacBook Pro can last about five hours unplugged .####[([1], 'POS')]
It was a hard decision for me since the MacBook Pro looked so appealing .####[]
1st hand experience is very important , especially for a new customer .####[]
I especially appreciate the fact that it has almost zero viruses and spyware problems !####[]
Even though it is much more expensive than many PC laptops , it is worth the price .####[]
I know there are way better laptops out there for the same price , and why spend money on shit when you can go out and get yourself a perfectly decent laptop that doesnt suck total monkey balls .####[([12], 'NEU')]
I do n't like this company nor the toshiba brand , and I 'll never buy another one because I 've put more into it then it is worth .####[]
ca n't reinstall with standard os cd because of proprietary hardware drivers .####[([4, 5, 6], 'NEG'), ([9, 10, 11], 'NEG')]
However , this will be my last as well .####[]
There is a small red circle next to it with a x in the middle , and when I click on it it says , Consider replacing your battery and it does not hold full charge .####[([28], 'NEU'), ([35], 'NEG')]
SO ? HOW CAN YOU SOLVE IT ? C'mon , I just bought the netbook 2 weeks ago .####[]
The computer was two weeks late in delivery because HP forgot to complete the required import paperwork .####[([7], 'NEG')]
If you 're looking for a great laptop , you 've found the best here .####[]
The first programm I switched on was a game for my children .####[([2], 'NEU')]
I have been very pleased with the performance of this laptop .####[([7], 'POS')]
I have had my MacBook for almost 6 months and can honestly say that I will NEVER buy another computer if it is not a Mac .####[]
I 've always owned a PC and decided to try a MacBook to see what it 's all about .####[]
On two occasions the computer s calendar told me it was 1969 .####[]
I bought it for my mom and she reports that the battery life lasts all day for her , it 's very lightweight , and the response for the computing she 's doing Internet focused activity , mail , research , etc is excellent ; .####[([11, 12], 'POS'), ([26], 'POS'), ([33, 34, 35], 'NEU')]
Its very nice and once you learn the features you will be so happy to have such a sophisticated computer .####[([8], 'NEU')]
Overall , this is a wonderful computer and definitly worth the purchase !####[]
It came alot faster than I thought it would have which was really exciting .####[]
Then to make matters worst , there is noone that they can transfer you to .####[]
It is sleek and lightweight and charges quickly when needed .####[([6], 'POS')]
also you may need to charge it once a day , if for medium use every thing fast and easy with mac the size and look is the most feature that attracted me to it .####[([5], 'NEU'), ([23], 'POS'), ([25], 'POS'), ([29], 'POS')]
But if you are in the computer field you probably would n't be here .####[]
The great 18 month same as cash financing and Advance Protection Plan which includes accidents like spills .####[]
I could not handle it one hand like I can the replacement computer I purchased .####[]
The new Macbook Pro 15 inch i7 is nothing short of amazing .####[]
i would never go back any more , i love this computer so much and i would recommend it to everyone .####[]
they respond , your dissatisfaction is noted .####[]
I was even able to uninstall McAffe and install one of my Symantec licenses with a no issues whatsoever .####[]
The iBook backup also uses a firewire connection .####[([1, 2], 'NEU'), ([6, 7], 'NEU')]
I did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements , but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before I purchased .####[([6], 'NEU'), ([21], 'NEU')]
Also the display is exceptional !####[([2], 'POS')]
This is basically the best laptop I have ever had or used .####[]
3DMARK6 score is only 8500 .####[]
I tell everyone I see out looking to get this or another Toshiba .####[]
So honestly , I was n't expecting anything less than perfection , and I was n't disappointed .####[]
Learning all of the keyboard shortcuts only took a few minutes to get used to as some of the shortcuts are the same on Windows machines .####[([4, 5], 'POS'), ([19], 'NEU')]
little short on RAM but you get what you pay for .####[([3], 'NEG')]
It did n't come with any software installed outside of windows media , but for the price , I was very pleased with the condition and the overall product .####[([6], 'NEG'), ([10, 11], 'NEU'), ([16], 'POS')]
The first one I had was a 2006 model , not the Pro .####[]
THEN , one month after the warranty expired , the replacement charger went .####[([6], 'NEU'), ([10, 11], 'NEG')]
2nd Mac book I have purchased from MacConnection .####[]
I love a pc but I was ready for a change and tired of the windows system .####[([15, 16], 'NEG')]
Your cursor will end up all over the freaking place , , , it 's not uncommon for me to accidentally delete words , sentences , paragraphs because of this mousepad .####[([1], 'NEG'), ([30], 'NEG')]
Other installed features , such as certain printer software , are also most attractive .####[([2], 'POS'), ([7, 8], 'POS')]
I normally do n't participate in reviews/surveys but this laptop has not given me any problems and hope to share my thoughts .####[]
Most of the large bags are for a 17 inch .####[]
I took it home and within 30 min , it was freezing up and did the blue screen of death .####[]
I think this computer is super lame .####[]
It had a seventeen inch screen which I wanted , but I did n't realize at the time it would be such a monster !####[]
Even doing so , the hinge may just be slightly tightened only .####[([5], 'NEU')]
company provides UPS shipping , fast , great !####[([3], 'POS')]
I would tell the technician I knew exactly what was wrong with it but they did not listen and I had to go through a bunch of junk to get them to tell me I needed to send the computer in .####[([4], 'NEG')]
I purchased two laptops for my husband and 16 year old daughter .####[]
More relieved than anything .####[]
Great product , very easy to use and great graphics .####[([6], 'POS'), ([9], 'POS')]
Summary , Spend your money elsewhere####[]
believe me apple has a reputation .####[]
The iLife software that comes with the computer is so simple to use and produces a great finished product .####[([1, 2], 'POS'), ([12], 'POS')]
The built-in webcam is great for Skype and similar video-chat services .####[([1, 2], 'POS')]
The shop will definitely push the problem to the service center .####[([9, 10], 'NEU')]
PC users work in Word , while Mac users work in Pages .####[([4], 'NEU'), ([11], 'NEU')]
I am able to organize my pics , music and files easily .####[]
While I mostly use it for email , internet and gaming , I 'm confident all other applications live up to the high standard I 've come to appreciate from Mac laptops .####[([8], 'NEU'), ([10], 'NEU'), ([17], 'POS')]
The perfect notebook .####[]
This laptop looks great on the surface , 17" inch screen , good price-point , nice appearance , boots up quickly , runs fast etc .####[([8, 9, 10], 'POS'), ([13], 'POS'), ([16], 'POS'), ([18, 19], 'POS'), ([22], 'POS')]
The apple systems are over priced luxurys that ar n't worth what they are being charged for , this model 's specifications are far from being impressive and they only thing you get out of this is the apple name .####[([21], 'NEG')]
My mac laptop is fabulous in both areas .####[]
pros , the macbook pro notebook has a large battery life and you wont have to worry to charge your laptop every five hours or so .####[([9, 10], 'POS')]
I highly recommend this product !####[]
Disappointing for such a lovely screen and at a reasonable price####[([5], 'POS'), ([10], 'POS')]
So far , it 's an average laptop , no better , no worse than the HP I replaced .####[]
The only bad thing about it is they give you the worst batteries possible .####[([12], 'NEG')]
Good price .####[([1], 'POS')]
THE MOTHERBOARD IS DEAD !####[([1], 'NEG')]
the speed is fine .####[([1], 'POS')]
I was starting to boil .####[]
Hmmm , that high failure rate sure is n't reflected in the retail price .####[([12, 13], 'NEG')]
BAck she goes !####[]
It was not clear that the Microsoft Student Edition that was loaded on the computer , was a six month trial .####[([6, 7, 8], 'NEG')]
not the day received .####[]
Good for every day computing and web browsing .####[([2, 3, 4], 'POS'), ([6, 7], 'POS')]
While lacking some of the functions of the other versions , this was very acceptable for the uses planned for this computer .####[]
Also , I have had alot of trouble with the keys sticking and will not type correctly .####[([10], 'NEG')]
It still seems to be a little lose now but so far seems to be hanging in there .####[]
It is by far one of the greatest investments I have ever made .####[]
If you are a PC user looking to convert I would HIGHLY recommend it !####[]
Excellent LED monitor and well equipped .####[([1, 2], 'POS')]
This process continued to repeat itself until the mother board had been replaced 4 times and the hard drive replaced 3 times .####[([8, 9], 'NEG'), ([17, 18], 'NEG')]
Without a doubt , the *ASPECT0* of this laptop is fantastic .####[]
I could n't believe how long the battery lasted on a single charge .####[([7], 'POS'), ([12], 'POS')]
I could save ten essay papers and have hardly any memory left .####[([10], 'NEG')]
Took a while to clean it up to my specs .####[]
They are so realistic I am just speechless .####[]
Other than that , I would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi-decent gaming capabilities .####[([18], 'POS')]
But the biggest pain is that tech support is not available 24/7 .####[([6, 7], 'NEG')]
There are differences that you need to know and take time to learn .####[]
They have more problems then a 1980 's computer .####[]
It is amazing .####[]
Needless to say , not to happy with the product .####[]
The cool thing about this is anyone can use it .####[]
My first laptop was an Acer that I got for Christmas .####[]
Still , this laptop is perfect for all day use at school and work .####[]
the internet can be an scary place its up to you on what you do with it .####[]
The backlit keys are wonderful when you are working in the dark .####[([1, 2], 'POS')]
I chose the iBookG4 , a laptop that is an attractive computer with a large screen big enough to please anyone .####[([15], 'POS')]
The most recent being that my Safari internet browser is freaking out on me , but I have just been using firefox instead .####[([6, 7, 8], 'NEG'), ([21], 'POS')]
I would say if you want to buy one of these machines be careful .####[]
I know what 7 hrs of battery looks like .####[([6], 'POS')]
The Macbooks worth every penny .####[]
I did not have to call the support line at all .####[([7, 8], 'NEU')]
The laptop is outstanding in all aspects except that it has the Windows 7 starter and not the full Windows 7 .####[([12, 13, 14], 'NEG'), ([19, 20], 'POS')]
THE FIRST PROBLEM IS THAT THE KEYBOARD FUNCTION IS SIMPLY UNSATISFACTORY .####[([6, 7], 'NEG')]
The DVD drive randomly pops open when it is in my backpack as well , which is annoying .####[([1, 2], 'NEG')]
Garageband is more for the musicians , and the laptop is equipped with a good working microphone , good enough for beginners and musicians at the intermediate level .####[([0], 'NEU'), ([16], 'POS')]
I dual boot with Linux and that other security-prone OS and it performs flawlessly .####[([4], 'NEU'), ([8, 9], 'NEU'), ([12], 'POS')]
The difference is the Toshiba had a lot more memory and hard drive space .####[([9], 'POS'), ([11, 12, 13], 'POS')]
There was a little difficulty doing the migration as the firewire cable system ca n't be used with the iBook .####[([10, 11, 12], 'NEG'), ([19], 'NEU')]
Do n't waste your money !####[]
-Managed to send complaint email .####[]
however , they were kind enough to send a replacement free of charge .####[]
Seriously considering a larger laptop to replace the Dell####[]
OS X is solid with lots of innovations such as quicklook which save heaps of time .####[([0, 1], 'POS'), ([10], 'POS')]
I do everything on this computer , check email , facebook , shop , check blogs , write papers , listen to music , and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv .####[]
I thought it would be a simple job .####[]
But other than that I am blown away by all the features this laptop offers .####[([11], 'POS')]
I Hate it !####[]
Do n't buy this model .####[]
The keyboard is slick and quiet and not bulky like some other laptops I have had in the past .####[([1], 'POS')]
Overall , this laptop is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from .####[([13], 'POS'), ([19], 'POS')]
I love this 13 Mac white unibody .####[]
the last time we took it to get fixed the guy said that most likely it is a reppative problem and will keep happeneing so hopefully we can get a new one very soon !####[]
When I am at Starbucks between clients I get full bars on my HP and 1 bar on my Eee PC .####[]
The PhotoBooth is a great program , it takes very good pictures with the built-in camera .####[([1], 'POS'), ([5], 'POS'), ([14, 15], 'POS')]
And inconvenient !####[]
Many kinds of software that is necessary to the working person is not available and can not be downloaded .####[([3], 'NEG')]
It is so speedy .####[]
Needs constant repair .####[]
I will never purchase a HP again ever .####[]
I had to pay for the shipping !####[([6], 'NEG')]
It bluescreened on me without any warning , running simply basic Chrome .####[([11], 'NEG')]
This is another reason to like the Mac .####[]
I took 3-4 years researching brands and prices of laptops .####[([7], 'NEU')]
One bad thing is it gets hot .####[]
I 'm stuck w/ a broken computer .####[]
