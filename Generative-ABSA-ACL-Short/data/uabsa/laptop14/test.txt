Boot time is super fast , around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute .####[([0, 1], 'POS')]
tech support would not fix the problem unless I bought your plan for $ 150 plus .####[([0, 1], 'NEG')]
but in resume this computer rocks !####[]
Set up was easy .####[([0, 1], 'POS')]
Did not enjoy the new Windows 8 and touchscreen functions .####[([5, 6], 'NEG'), ([8, 9], 'NEG')]
I expected so as it 's an Apple product , but I was glad to see my expectations exceeded , this is THE laptop to buy right now .####[]
Other than not being a fan of click pads industry standard these days and the lousy internal speakers , it 's hard for me to find things about this notebook I do n't like , especially considering the $ 350 price tag .####[([7, 8], 'NEG'), ([16, 17], 'NEG'), ([40, 41], 'POS')]
excellent in every way .####[]
No installation disk (DVD) is included .####[([1, 2, 3], 'NEU')]
It 's fast , light , and simple to use .####[([9], 'POS')]
Works well , and I am extremely happy to be back to an apple OS .####[([0], 'POS'), ([13, 14], 'POS')]
This mac has been a problem since we got it .####[]
Sure it 's not light and slim but the features make up for it 100 % .####[([9], 'POS')]
I am pleased with the fast log on , speedy WiFi connection and the long battery life > 6 hrs .####[([6, 7], 'POS'), ([10, 11], 'POS'), ([15, 16], 'POS')]
The Apple engineers have not yet discovered the delete key .####[([8, 9], 'NEG')]
Made interneting part of my business very difficult to maintain .####[([1], 'NEG')]
Luckily , for all of us contemplating the decision , the Mac Mini is priced just right .####[([14], 'POS')]
Small and still VERY powerful .####[]
I had gotten this model for $ 119900 on my State 's tax-free weekend and had a $ 100 off coupon for a MacBook at the local BestBuy ! .####[]
Super light , super sexy and everything just works .####[([8], 'POS')]
Only problem that I had was that the track pad was not very good for me , I only had a problem once or twice with it , But probably my computer was a bit defective .####[([8, 9], 'NEG')]
And if you are switching from a pc I hilghy sugest this one .####[]
It is super fast and has outstanding graphics .####[([7], 'POS')]
But the mountain lion is just too slow .####[([2, 3], 'NEG')]
Strong build though which really adds to its durability .####[([1], 'POS'), ([8], 'POS')]
The battery life is excellent 6-7 hours without charging .####[([1, 2], 'POS')]
I enjoy having apple products .####[]
I 've had my computer for 2 weeks already and it works perfectly .####[([11], 'POS')]
I will never go back to a PC again !####[]
And I may be the only one but I am really liking Windows 8 .####[([12, 13], 'POS')]
The baterry is very longer .####[([1], 'POS')]
And it 's so quiet that I do n't hear it at all .####[]
Its size is ideal and the weight is acceptable .####[([1], 'POS'), ([6], 'POS')]
I know Apples are more expensive than PCs , but he thinks it is worth every penny .####[]
To me it 's a workhorse and quiet as can be you even save big bucks not dishing out any extra to Uncle Sam Definite Buy .####[]
I can say that I am fully satisfied with the performance that the computer has supplied .####[([10], 'POS')]
I 'm pretty sure when I bought it , my bank account went ouch !####[]
Thank you so much for the great item .####[]
This laptop has only 2 USB ports , and they are both on the same side .####[([5, 6], 'NEG')]
It 's annoying very much and I wo n't ever buy any Acer products .####[]
This is why I purchased a BRAND NEW LAPTOP in the first place so it would n't have ANY problems .####[]
It has so much more speed and the screen is very sharp .####[([5], 'POS'), ([8], 'POS')]
As for the laptop , this is our 3rd Apple computer in the past 2 years .####[]
Everything I wanted and everything I needed and the price was great !####[([9], 'POS')]
It 's not inexpensive but the Hardware performance is impressive for a computer this small .####[([6, 7], 'POS')]
It is better than my old acer laptop .####[]
This thing is awesome , everything always works , everything is always easy to set up , everything is compatible , its literally everything I could ask for .####[([7], 'POS'), ([14, 15], 'POS')]
I would buy it again in a heartbeat !####[]
Keyboard responds well to presses .####[([0], 'POS')]
If someone called me an Apple Fanboyit would make sense .####[]
Lastly , Windows 8 is annoying .####[([2, 3], 'NEG')]
A scratch on a $ 1,500 MacBook is unforgivable .####[]
I just fell in love with this thing .####[]
Everything is so easy and intuitive to setup or configure .####[([7], 'POS'), ([9], 'POS')]
I have no problems yet on my mac so far , and hope it stays like that .####[]
This laptop is a great buy .####[]
Biggest complaint is Windows 8 .####[([3, 4], 'NEG')]
Only 2 usb ports kind oflimited .####[([2, 3], 'NEG')]
It has been to early to see if this actually fixes the problem or not though .####[]
This device has met my expectations and I 'm sure it will meet yours .####[]
It has all the expected features and more +plus a wide screen and more than roomy keyboard .####[([5], 'POS'), ([11], 'POS'), ([16], 'POS')]
Out of all the laptops I have owned , this is by far the best !####[]
Amazing Performance for anything I throw at it .####[([1], 'POS')]
I can never go back to a PC now , this machine never freezes or has any problems .####[]
Out of the box I noticed how small it was and was exactly what I was looking for .####[]
The receiver was full of superlatives for the quality and performance .####[([8], 'POS'), ([10], 'POS')]
I was extremely happy with the OS itself .####[([6], 'POS')]
I was looking for something in between a regular laptop and a tablet and this is it .####[]
The new MBP offers great portability and gives us confidence that we are not going to need to purchase a new laptop in 18 months .####[([5], 'POS')]
Great purchase and I definitely did n't miss out on the Black Friday deals .####[]
The criticism has waned , and now I 'd be the first to recommend an Air for truly portable computing .####[([18, 19], 'POS')]
I would have given it 5 starts was it not for the fact that it had Windows 8####[([16, 17], 'NEG')]
MS Office 2011 for Mac is wonderful , well worth it .####[([0, 1, 2, 3, 4], 'POS')]
After using it for over a month , an issue started to surface .####[]
But the performance of Mac Mini is a huge disappointment .####[([2], 'NEG')]
There has been no problem with anything .####[]
I believe with Apple , you get what you pay for .####[]
They do n't just look good ; they deliver excellent performance .####[([4], 'POS'), ([10], 'POS')]
I have had it over a year now with out a Glitch of any kindI love the lit up keys and screen display thing is Fast and clear as can be .####[([17, 18, 19], 'POS'), ([21, 22], 'POS')]
The product is prefect for everyone .####[]
The Mountain Lion OS is not hard to figure out if you are familiar with Microsoft Windows .####[([1, 2, 3], 'POS'), ([15, 16], 'NEU')]
However , I can refute that OSX is FAST .####[([6], 'NEG')]
I waited to review to make sure it is what it is .####[]
Enjoy using Microsoft Office !####[([2, 3], 'POS')]
I would suggest this product to anyone .####[]
With no problems , I 'm happy with this purchase because I saved money compared to buying it anywhere else .####[]
Incredible graphics and brilliant colors .####[([1], 'POS'), ([4], 'POS')]
I needed something affordable from Apple and was tired of dealing with PC laptop after PC laptop .####[]
Just bit the bullet and bought the Mac hoping it will last a lot longer .####[]
Built-in apps are purely amazing .####[([0, 1], 'POS')]
Cons , Screen resolution .####[([2, 3], 'NEG')]
From the speed to the multi touch gestures this operating system beats Windows easily .####[([2], 'POS'), ([5, 6, 7], 'POS'), ([9, 10], 'POS'), ([12], 'NEG')]
I really like the size and I 'm a fan of the ACERS .####[([4], 'POS')]
This is by far thee best , most reliable computer I could find .####[]
I opted for the SquareTrade 3-Year Computer Accidental Protection Warranty $ 1500-2000 which also support accidents like drops and spills that are NOT covered by AppleCare .####[([4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 'POS'), ([25], 'NEG')]
It 's light and easy to transport .####[([6], 'POS')]
Once you get past learning how to use the poorly designed Windows 8 Set-Up you may feel frustrated .####[([11, 12, 13], 'NEG')]
Very powerful especially for the money .####[]
When my Dell laptop gave up only after 2 1/2 years , I decided to buy MacBook Pro .####[]
It 's been time for a new laptop , and the only debate was which size of the Mac laptops , and whether to spring for the retina display .####[([15], 'NEU'), ([27, 28], 'NEU')]
This was a significan'tly more affordable than getting a new MacBook Pro from Apple .####[]
I have always wanted a MacBook Proalways ! .####[]
The reason why I choose apple MacBook because of their design and the aluminum casing .####[([10], 'POS'), ([13, 14], 'POS')]
The aluminum body sure makes it stand out .####[([1, 2], 'POS')]
Overall it 's an amazing product , 5 stars !####[]
It is very easy to integrate bluetooth devices , and USB devices are recognized almost instantly .####[([5, 6, 7], 'POS'), ([10, 11], 'POS')]
He 's thrilled with his new laptop .####[]
Amazing product as you would expect from Apple .####[]
Nothing wrong with this computer at all !####[]
And the fact that Apple is driving the 13 RMBP with the Intel4000 graphic chip seems underpowered to me .####[([12, 13, 14], 'NEG')]
I have to wonder why Amazon is even selling this dinosaur .####[]
Apple removed the DVD drive Firewire port will work with adapter and put the SDXC slot in a silly position on the back .####[([3, 4, 5, 6], 'NEU'), ([10], 'NEU'), ([14, 15], 'NEG')]
No hassle and no complaints .####[]
LOVE IT I 've always been an apple fan boy , but never had the money to buy a mac , only ipads and iphones , and this is my first mac , blew me away completely .####[]
The durability of the laptop will make it worth the money .####[([1], 'POS')]
Well designed and fast .####[([1], 'POS')]
And now I am a proud MacBook owner also !####[]
But I was completely wrong , this computer is UNBELIEVABLE amazing and easy to use .####[([14], 'POS')]
Exactly as posted plus a great value .####[([6], 'POS')]
The specs are pretty good too .####[([1], 'POS')]
I am having a friend look at it , but will probably return it .####[]
There were no scratches or dents or any marks at all .####[]
I 've only had it one day , but I really do love it and I 'm happy it was economical and I 'm finally able to own a Mac !####[]
Since I have always used Apple products , the choice of Macbook Pro was obvious .####[]
Apple is unmatched in product quality , aesthetics , craftmanship , and customer service .####[([4, 5], 'POS'), ([7], 'POS'), ([9], 'POS'), ([12, 13], 'POS')]
This is my first apple laptop .####[]
It makes a great gift .####[]
It is a great size and amazing windows 8 included !####[([4], 'POS'), ([7, 8], 'POS')]
I would recommend to any one lloking for a first class computer !####[]
I do not like too much Windows 8 .####[([6, 7], 'NEG')]
Startup times are incredibly long , over two minutes .####[([0, 1], 'NEG')]
I bought this Macbook Pro from Best Buy under a year ago to replace my old Macbook Air .####[]
The macbook pro is really responsive .####[]
Also stunning colors and speedy####[([2], 'POS')]
it is really expensive though .####[]
great price free shipping what else can i ask for ! !####[([1], 'POS'), ([3], 'POS')]
This mouse is terrific .####[([1], 'POS')]
I will also say it is much better than I expected !####[]
This computer does everything i need it to do for school and more .####[]
It is really thick around the battery .####[([6], 'NEU')]
And windows 7 works like a charm .####[([1, 2], 'POS')]
And I can attach my projector to it .####[]
, Great product , great price , great delivery , and great service .####[([5], 'POS'), ([8], 'POS'), ([12], 'POS')]
, ] It arrived so fast and customer service was great .####[([7, 8], 'POS')]
tried windows 8 and hated it ! ! !####[([1, 2], 'NEG')]
The price is higher than most lab top out there ; however , he/she will get what they paid for , which is a great computer .####[]
So , I thought why not give Mac Book pro a try .####[]
Set up was a breeze .####[([0, 1], 'POS')]
But I do NOT like Win8 .####[([5], 'NEG')]
I have owned at least 4 to 5 laptops and computers , but this is by far the most superior machine I have ever owned .####[]
I am still in the process of learning about its features .####[([10], 'NEU')]
BTW , I checked online regarding the old laptop that died and found that I was not alone , far from it .####[]
I had the same reasons as most PC users , the price , the overbearing restrictions of OSX and lack of support for games .####[([11], 'NEG'), ([17], 'NEG'), ([21, 22, 23], 'NEG')]
I wanted it for it 's mobility and man , this little bad boy is very nice .####[([6], 'POS')]
Seems to me that 's the best way to get Apple 's attention .####[]
Very nice so far .####[]
You wo n't be disappointed .####[]
The investment of a new MacBook Pro came at a price , but totally worth it for a good piece of mind .####[]
I found the mini to be , Exceptionally easy to set up####[([10, 11], 'POS')]
Having USB3 is why I bought this Mini .####[([1], 'POS')]
Be sure to have good air flow where ever you put it .####[]
The sound is nice and loud ; I do n't have any problems with hearing anything .####[([1], 'POS')]
It is very slim , the track pad is very much impressed with me .####[([6, 7], 'POS')]
This was the same problem with my MacBook circa 2007 that I just retired .####[]
Great things come in small packages .####[]
HUGE Apple MAC Fan !####[]
Looked at HP , ASUS , Acer , Sony and a bunch of other ones but could not find I really liked .####[]
The settings are not user-friendly either .####[([1], 'NEG')]
Honestly , I am surprised no one else has mentioned returning theirs .####[]
Most of them were either too big , too noisy and too slow after 2 years .####[]
The machine is used , but is like new , i 'm very impress .####[]
Thank goodness for OpenOffice !####[([3], 'POS')]
Awesome form factor , great battery life , wonderful UX .####[([1, 2], 'POS'), ([5, 6], 'POS'), ([9], 'POS')]
Needless to say , the leap from that to this has been amazing and aside from the financial reasons I am astounded that I had n't made the switch sooner .####[]
Its perfect , not much heavy .####[]
i love the keyboard and the screen .####[([3], 'POS'), ([6], 'POS')]
I find it not to be very user friendly .####[]
It has surpassed all expectations and fulfilled all my needs .####[]
However , there are MAJOR issues with the touchpad which render the device nearly useless .####[([8], 'NEG')]
What angers me more than anything else is that I spent all those years hating MACs when I could have been getting a lot more production with a whole lot less grief !####[]
I 've already upgraded o Mavericks and I am impressed with everything about this computer .####[([5], 'POS')]
So this is very good commputer and i highly suggest it .####[]
the mbp i recieved was everything it should have been .####[]
I was going to buy today and noticed it went back up to $ 34499 ? .####[]
Not as fast as I would have expect for an i5 .####[([10], 'NEG')]
SO of course this one came through with the awesomeness !####[]
You will not regret buying this computer !####[]
Nothing bad to say about it .####[]
It s heavy for Mac book but is good .####[]
thanks for great service and shipping !####[([3], 'POS'), ([5], 'POS')]
Deal of the year .####[]
My sisters same laptop broke about the month later for the same reason .####[]
Minis make sense for a lot of people .####[]
The performance seems quite good , and built-in applications like iPhoto work great with my phone and camera .####[([1], 'POS'), ([7, 8], 'POS'), ([10], 'POS')]
This Mac Mini makes the Macbook Pro seem slow .####[]
I did swap out the hard drive for a Samsung 830 SSD which I highly recommend .####[([5, 6], 'NEU'), ([9, 10, 11], 'POS')]
I bought this MacBook Pro to replace my six-year-old PC a Sony Vaio , but it was basically no better than my old PC , so I returned it .####[]
I wanted a simple , reliable laptop .####[]
Cheaper than buying it @ apple too !####[]
I have just had to learn to be a little harder typer than on my last computer .####[]
Extremely disappointed with the way it is .####[]
Never been happier using computer .####[]
I have had a total of 5 different laptop from many different manufactures .####[]
Does everything I wanted this laptop to do .####[]
Besides , the apple stocks have been falling due to lack of sales .####[]
Turns out this is a common problem .####[]
Starts up in a hurry and everything is ready to go .####[([0, 1], 'POS')]
It is also fast as can be you get what you pay for well worth the investment .####[]
But I 'm still learning so ca n't rate it yet for everything .####[]
Overall very impressed , Thank you Apple and Amazon !####[]
Yes , that 's a good thing , but it 's made from aluminum that scratches easily .####[([13], 'NEG')]
Very fast for my needs .####[]
I bought this Mac in order to replace my old Dell laptop .####[]
Quick and has built in virus control .####[([3, 4, 5, 6], 'POS')]
Took a long time trying to decide between one with retina display and one without .####[([10, 11], 'NEU')]
I saw the Mini Mac at Best Buy and decided to get this as my replacement .####[]
I finally decided on this one and could n't be any happier .####[]
I was also informed that the components of the Mac Book were dirty .####[([6], 'NEG')]
So glad I did not waste money on a less than par product .####[]
Have n't regretted it one bit .####[]
The one thing that Apple does right is computers .####[]
the hardware problems have been so bad , i ca n't wait till it completely dies in 3 years , TOPS !####[([1], 'NEG')]
It 's so nice that the battery last so long and that this machine has the snow lion !####[([6], 'POS'), ([16, 17], 'POS')]
I think that they are the best out on the market .####[]
HOWEVER I chose two day shipping and it took over a week to arrive .####[([5], 'NEG')]
That 's quite a bump up from the $ 599 that this little guy sells for , which leaves me to my next point .####[]
this is quite smooth as well as heavy and can easily slip through the hands .####[]
My laptop is so light that I can take it with me anywhere .####[]
it 's exactly what i wanted , and it has all the new features and whatnot .####[([13], 'POS')]
You can do absolutely anything and is very fast and stylish .####[]
Finally decided to try a MAC because there were too many choices of which PC 's to buy and EVERYONE who had a MAC said buy a MAC .####[]
Can you buy any laptop that matches the quality of a MacBook ?####[([8], 'POS')]
It feels cheap , the keyboard is not very sensitive .####[([5], 'NEG')]
That defeated the whole point of a laptop .####[]
Though please note that sometimes it crashes , and the sound quality isnt superb .####[([10, 11], 'NEG')]
It is very easy to navigate even for a novice .####[([5], 'POS')]
But until now , no complains at all .####[]
The cons are more annoyances that can be lived with .####[]
Does everything I need it to , has a wonderful battery life and I could n't be happier .####[([10, 11], 'POS')]
Great Performance and Quality .####[([1], 'POS'), ([3], 'POS')]
Just What I Needed For Portable And My Wallet Too !####[]
The device speaks about it self .####[]
I used windows XP , windows Vista , and Windows 7 extensively .####[([2, 3], 'NEU'), ([5, 6], 'NEU'), ([9, 10], 'NEU')]
the only thing that bums me out about this purchase is they released a newer updated mbp seriously RIGHT after i bought this one .####[]
it does get hot when using on a bed or sofa and gets warm on a deskthis is in an un-air conditioned roomin air condition it gets slightly warm .####[]
I did add a SSD drive and memory####[([4, 5], 'NEU'), ([7], 'NEU')]
I got this one for thanks giving Offer for $ 962 , .####[]
I had my PC laptop for 3 years and going to a MacBook Pro is like I leaped through time .####[]
On start up it asks endless questions just so itune can sell you more of their products .####[([1, 2], 'NEG'), ([9], 'NEG')]
Pretty much made sense to get a Mini .####[]
I Have been a Pc user for a very long time now but I will get used to this new OS .####[([20], 'NEU')]
not something you want to miss out on ! ! !####[]
One more thing , this mac does NOT come with restore disks and I am not sure if you can make them direct from the mac like you can with newer PC 's , also the charging cables are made of the same cheap material as the iPhone/iPod touch cables .####[([10, 11], 'NEG'), ([36, 37], 'NEG'), ([44], 'NEG')]
I bought it to my son who uses it for graphic design .####[([10, 11], 'NEU')]
I previously owned an older Dell laptop that died after about 5 or 6 years .####[]
Its a pretty decent computer .####[]
I never tried any external mics with that iMac .####[([4, 5], 'NEU')]
The new os is great on my macbook pro !####[([2], 'POS')]
It was fast , and it was different .####[]
I had a little problem adjusting to the small screen but works fine as long as I remember to carry my glasses .####[]
I purchased my first Mac and am glad I did .####[]
I have experienced no problems , works as anticipated .####[([6], 'POS')]
System is running great .####[([0], 'POS')]
Easy to customize setting and even create your own bookmarks .####[([2, 3], 'POS'), ([6, 7, 8, 9], 'POS')]
They really screwed the pooch on this one .####[]
The MAC Mini , wireless keyboard / mouse and a HDMI cable is all I need to get some real work done .####[([4, 5, 6, 7], 'NEU'), ([10, 11], 'NEU')]
I finally pulled the trigger and I am blown away by how much more I enjoy my computer tasks using the Mac Mini ! ! !####[]
it has all the features that we expected and the price was good , working well so far .####[([4], 'POS'), ([10], 'POS'), ([14], 'POS')]
I work as a designer and coder and I needed a new buddy to work with , not gaming .####[([18], 'NEU')]
I was told that it seems to be a multi , component failure .####[]
The new operating system makes this computer into a super iPad .####[([2, 3], 'POS')]
I am very happy with my first Mac .####[]
Easy to set up and go !####[([2, 3], 'POS')]
I ca n't believe how quiet the hard drive is and how quick this thing boots up .####[([7, 8], 'POS'), ([15, 16], 'POS')]
The only issue came when I tried scanning to the mac .####[([7], 'NEG')]
The machine is speedy and efficient .####[]
I think this is about as good as it gets at anything close to this price point .####[([15, 16], 'NEU')]
A *big* upgrade from my 13 2006 macbook .####[]
It 's just what we were looking for and it works great .####[([10], 'POS')]
Having a Mac certainly makes life easier .####[]
It 's so quick and responsive that it makes working on a computer so much more pleasurable !####[([9], 'POS')]
The old unibody macbook pro could fry an egg after a while .####[]
It works fine , and all the software seems to run pretty well .####[([1], 'POS'), ([7], 'POS')]
For this purpose , it 's great .####[]
Could n't have asked for more !####[]
I 'm using this computer for word processing , web browsing , some gaming , and I 'm learning programming .####[([6, 7], 'NEU'), ([9, 10], 'NEU'), ([13], 'NEU'), ([19], 'NEU')]
It certainly does , but you rarely hear any of your friends with Mac 's complain about anything .####[]
My wife was so excited to open the box , but quickly came to see that it did not function as it should .####[([19], 'NEG')]
I do n't have any technical pearls to share .####[]
I wanted a computer that was quite , fast , and that had overall great performance .####[([15], 'NEU')]
Apple "Help" is a mixed bag .####[([0, 1], 'NEG')]
All I can say is I am impressed .####[]
It suddenly can not work .####[([4], 'NEG')]
It did everything we expected !####[]
Harddrive was in poor condition , had to replace it .####[([0], 'NEG')]
The on/off switch is a bit obscure in the rear corner .####[([1, 2], 'NEG')]
It 's a nice little gadget .####[]
My only complaint is the total lack of instructions that come with the mac mini .####[([8], 'NEG')]
The only task that this computer would not be good enough for would be gaming , otherwise the integrated Intel 4000 graphics work well for other tasks .####[([14], 'NEG')]
It 's macbook pro and there is no discusion about it .####[]
I 'm hoping the rest of the features will be the signature quality of apple .####[]
I use it mostly for content creation Audio , video , photo editing and its reliable .####[([5, 6, 7], 'POS'), ([9], 'POS'), ([11, 12], 'POS')]
It is the best all around Mac .####[]
Screen is bright and gorgeous .####[([0], 'POS')]
Also is portable and reliable .####[]
The only solution is to turn the brightness down , etc .####[([7], 'NEU')]
It is not an easy decision to purchase a used or even good as new laptop but I am very satisfied .####[]
If you want more information on macs I suggest going to applecom and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the applications .####[([23], 'NEU')]
It is robust , with a friendly use as all Apple products .####[([7], 'POS')]
Even if you do n't do business , thats okay , it 's incredibly fast .####[]
It is fast and easy to use .####[([6], 'POS')]
This was absolutely annoying !####[]
And the fact that it comes with an i5 processor definitely speeds things up####[([8, 9], 'POS')]
But for those of you that do n't have a mac and are still on the PC 's this is a good foot in the door into mac .####[]
I have been PC for years but this computer is intuitive and its built in features are a great help####[([13, 14, 15], 'POS')]
and it fits in my briefcase with ease####[]
Nice screen , keyboard works great !####[([1], 'POS'), ([3], 'POS')]
Still not bad for 22000 .####[]
I was amazed at how fast the delivery was .####[([7], 'POS')]
Good computer and fast .####[]
I 've installed to it additional SSD and 16Gb RAM .####[([6], 'NEU'), ([8, 9], 'NEU')]
The memory was gone and it was not able to be used .####[([1], 'NEG')]
Its pretty much fire it up and go .####[]
It works great and I am so happy I bought it .####[([1], 'POS')]
Let me start off by saying that I was highly reluctant to spend so much money on a laptop .####[]
I like the design and ease of use with the keyboard , plenty of ports .####[([3], 'POS'), ([10], 'POS'), ([14], 'POS')]
Apple is living up to its name with the mini and , for our needs , it 's perfect .####[]
it definitely beats my old mac and the service was great .####[([8], 'POS')]
I went from a Macbook to this Mac Mini and this was a great upgrade !####[]
Web browsing is very quick with Safari browser .####[([0, 1], 'POS'), ([6, 7], 'POS')]
It could n't have been a better decision .####[]
I like the lighted screen at night .####[([3, 4], 'POS')]
It 's great to have a solid Mac in the living room .####[]
It is really easy to use and it is quick to start up .####[([5], 'POS'), ([11, 12], 'POS')]
I 've lived with the crashes and slow operation and restarts .####[([8], 'NEG')]
Very light and easily maneuverable .####[]
USB3 Peripherals are noticably less expensive than the ThunderBolt ones .####[([0, 1], 'POS'), ([8], 'NEG')]
This can be annoying at first but you just have to train yourself not to to start over so far .####[]

Runs like a champ .####[([0], 'POS')]
Really greatWell let me start at the beginning .####[]
Premium price for the OS more than anything else .####[([1], 'POS'), ([4], 'NEU')]
This was a gift for my grand son .####[]
I was a little concerned about the touch pad based on reviews , but I 've found it fine to work with .####[([7, 8], 'POS')]
I bought this Mac book pro along with a new 27 iMac and while they are still light years more reliable than a PC I have noticed a decline in the reliability of my Mac computers .####[]
The sound as mentioned earlier is n't the best , but it can be solved with headphones .####[([16], 'NEU')]
The track pad is a bit squirrely at times sometimes too sensitive , and sometimes a bit unresponsive , but it 's usable .####[]
However , the experience was great since the OS does not become unstable and the application will simply shutdown and reopen .####[([8], 'POS'), ([15], 'POS')]
Then only FOUR months later , my great MacBook pro FAILED .####[]
If you ask me , for this price it should be included .####[([7], 'NEG')]
The battery is not as shown in the product photos .####[([1], 'NEG')]
Even though I could have gotten a pc twice the speed for the same price I still think there 's nothing like a Mac .####[]
Seems a much more economical way to get into Apple than their other computers .####[]
Shipping was quick and product described was the product sent and so much more .####[([0], 'POS')]
I 'm so disgusted that I wasted my money on this product .####[]
All you get is a box and a computer .####[]
the retina display display make pictures i took years ago jaw dropping .####[([1, 2, 3], 'POS')]
Its only crashed on me one time in the 3 months i 've had it .####[]
The Mac Mini is probably the simplest example of compact computing out there .####[([9, 10], 'POS')]
Instead , I 'll focus more on the actual performance and feature set of the hardware itself so you can make an educated decision on which Mac to buy .####[([9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], 'NEU')]
My bag just got a little lighter .####[]
I 'm Not exagerating when I say this computer is perfecti It is ! ! .####[]
This machine is flawless , fast , and classy .####[]
Other ports include FireWire 800 , Gigabit Ethernet , MagSafe port , Microphone jack .####[([1], 'NEU'), ([3, 4], 'NEU'), ([6, 7], 'NEU'), ([9, 10], 'NEU'), ([12, 13], 'NEU')]
I stayed up half the night enjoying my new MacBook Pro .####[]
This laptop is a 100 times better than a Chromebook !####[]
Additionally , there is barely a ventilation system in the computer , and even the simple activity of watching videos let alone playing steam games causes the laptop to get very very hot , and in fact impossible to keep on lap .####[([6, 7], 'NEG'), ([18, 19], 'NEU'), ([22, 23, 24], 'NEU')]
At $ 1899 to start , this is no cheap machine .####[]
Chatting with Acer support , I was advised the problem was corrupted operating system files .####[([2, 3], 'NEU'), ([12, 13, 14], 'NEU')]
It 's been a couple weeks since the purchase and I 'm struggle with finding the correct keys but that was expected .####[([17], 'NEU')]
Many people complain about the new OS , and it 's urgent for Apple to fix it asap !####[([6], 'NEG')]
Now that I have upgraded to Lion I am much happier about MAC OS and have just bought an iMac for office .####[([6], 'POS'), ([12, 13], 'POS')]
User upgradeable RAM and HDD .####[([2], 'POS'), ([4], 'POS')]
But I wanted the Pro for the CD/DVD player .####[([7, 8], 'POS')]
I might have read it incorrectly , but better safe than sorry right ?####[]
The ultimate graduation gift .####[]
The RAM memory is good but should have splurged for 8Mb instead of 4Mb .####[]
was debating to buy one for months , checked out different stuff on youtube , and read different articles and debates , I just did n't really wan na spend the money but Im glad that I did .####[]
I love it and would recommend it to everyone who is tired of the constant attention PC 's require .####[]
I was a little worry at first because I do n't have a lot of experience with os.x and windows has always been second nature to me after many years of using windows .####[([17], 'NEU'), ([19], 'POS'), ([32], 'POS')]
I am an Info Sys major in college , so I started researching this issue on my own .####[]
Solution , it turned out to be pretty simple .####[]
With the softwares supporting the use of other OS makes it much better .####[([2], 'NEU'), ([8], 'NEU')]
Still have n't solved this .####[]
I then upgraded to Mac OS X 10.8 "Mountain Lion" .####[([4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 'NEU')]
It is EXTREMELY fast and never lags .####[]
I told them that I just received my brand new MacBook but I was having issues .####[]
I was considering buying the Air , but in reality , this one has a more powerful performance and seems much more convenient , even though it 's about 20 inch thicker and 2 lbs heavier .####[([17], 'POS')]
At home and the office it gets plugged into an external 24" LCD screen , so built in screen size is not terribly important .####[([10, 11, 12, 13], 'NEU'), ([16, 17, 18, 19], 'NEU')]
Hopefully my replacement is brand new .####[]
Just beware no DVD slot so when I went to install software I had on CD I could n't .####[([3, 4], 'NEU'), ([10, 11], 'NEG')]
I bought it to be able to dedicate a small , portable laptop to my writing and was surprised to learn that I needed to buy a word processing program to do so .####[([27, 28, 29], 'NEU')]
This version of MacBook Pro runs on a third-generation CPU ("Ivy Bridge") , not the latest fourth-generation Haswell CPU the 2013 version has .####[([8, 9, 10, 11], 'NEU'), ([16, 17, 18], 'NEU')]
Actually , I think I was intimidated by the change from a PC .####[]
No Cd Rom in the new version there 's no way I 'm spending that kind of money on something has less features than the older version .####[([1, 2], 'NEU'), ([22], 'NEG')]
Definitely worth spending the money on it .####[]
I have three words , Piece of Junk !####[]
the volume is really low to low for a laptopwas not expectin t volume to be so lowan i hate that about this computer####[([1], 'NEG'), ([13], 'NEG')]
Fits all my personal needs .####[]
I 'm the pro-active type so I went off and did some preventative fixes .####[]
and its not hard to accidentally bang it against something so i recommend getting a case to protect it .####[([15], 'NEU')]
I wanted to explore what the Mac was all about .####[]
I got this at an amazing price from Amazon and it arrived just in time .####[([6], 'POS')]
Every time I log into the system after a few hours , there is this endlessly frustrating process that I have to go through .####[([3, 4, 5, 6], 'NEG')]
The majority of the reviews seem to be for the 133 MacBook Pro Model # MD101LL/A .####[]
Put a SSD and use a 21" LED screen , this set up is silky smooth !####[([2], 'NEU'), ([6, 7, 8], 'NEU'), ([11, 12], 'POS')]
I saw the bad reviews from people saying to buy directly from Apple and I was concerned but I took my chances and am overly impressed .####[]
The case is now slightly larger than the previous generation , but the lack of an external power supply justifies the small increase in size .####[([1], 'NEG'), ([16, 17, 18], 'NEU')]
I had to buy a wireless mouse to go with it , as I am old school and hate the pad , but knew that before I bought it , now it works great , need to get adjusted to the key board , as I am used to a bigger one and pounding .####[([5, 6], 'NEU'), ([20], 'NEG'), ([32], 'POS'), ([41, 42], 'NEU')]
When considering a Mac , look at the total cost of ownership and not just the initial price tag .####[([9, 10, 11], 'NEU'), ([17, 18], 'NEU')]
Has all the other features I wanted including a VGA port , HDMI , ethernet and 3 USB ports .####[([4], 'POS'), ([9, 10], 'NEU'), ([12], 'NEU'), ([14], 'NEU'), ([17, 18], 'NEU')]
A great college tool !####[]
The only thing I dislike about this laptop are the rubber pads found on the bottom of the computer for grip .####[([10, 11], 'NEG')]
I called apple and no solution .####[]
It 's a decent computer for the price and hopefully it will last a long time .####[([7], 'NEU')]
I was really happy because it is a much better price on amazoncom than it was in the Mac store .####[]
The worst a Mac ever did to me was freeze up .####[]
The nicest part is the low heat output and ultra quiet operation .####[([6, 7], 'POS'), ([11], 'POS')]
I am paying apple to kill my self and my wallet .####[]
NO STAR FOR THIS TRASH [ .####[]
I will upgrade the ram myself because with this model you can you can do it later on .####[([2, 3, 4], 'POS')]
The price is 200 dollars down .####[([1], 'POS')]
this Mac Mini does not have a built-in mic , and it would seem that its Mac OS 10.9 does not handle external microphones properly .####[([7, 8], 'NEU'), ([16, 17, 18], 'NEG'), ([22, 23], 'NEU')]
A lot of features and shortcuts on the MBP that I was never exposed to on a normal PC .####[([3], 'NEU'), ([5], 'NEU')]
Was n't sure if I was going to like it much less love it so I went to a local best buy and played around with the IOS system on a Mac Pro and it was totally unique and different .####[([27, 28], 'POS')]
Quietest laptop I have ever owned .####[]
air has higher resolution but the fonts are small .####[([3], 'POS'), ([6], 'NEG')]
again this is just my personal honest opinion .####[]
If you have much higher expectations than that I would look elsewhere .####[]
working with Mac is so much easier , so many cool features .####[([0], 'POS'), ([11], 'POS')]
I 'm going to buy a logitevh c270 .####[]
Very happy with my purchase .####[]
I like the brightness and adjustments .####[([3], 'POS'), ([5], 'POS')]
I 'M SO HAPPY WITH MY macbook pro !####[]
I only wish this mac had a CD/DVD player built in .####[([7, 8], 'NEU')]
The only thing I miss is that my old Alienware laptop had backlit keys .####[([12, 13], 'NEG')]
The only thing I miss are the "Home/End" type keys and other things that I grew accustomed to after so long .####[([7, 8, 9], 'NEU')]
So happy with this purchase , I just wish it came with Microsoft Word .####[([12, 13], 'NEU')]
It is more than enough computer to keep up with the needs of a high school student .####[]
It has enough memory and speed to run my business with all the flexibility that comes with a laptop .####[([3], 'POS'), ([5], 'POS'), ([13], 'POS')]
The speed , the simplicity , the design it is lightyears ahead of any PC I have ever owned .####[([1], 'POS'), ([4], 'POS'), ([7], 'POS')]
I love everything about this computer .####[]
I found it toughest to decide between Dell ultra books and Apple .####[]
The battery life is excellent , the display is excellent , and downloading apps is a breeze .####[([1, 2], 'POS'), ([7], 'POS'), ([12, 13], 'POS')]
The screen , the software and the smoothness of the operating system .####[([1], 'POS'), ([4], 'POS'), ([10, 11], 'POS')]
While we struggle with all the crashes and viruses , the kids computers stay consistent and so we caved in and bought one for buisness !####[]
I do n't want to RUN a computer ; I want to USE a computer .####[]
i have dropped mine a couple times with only a slim plastic case covering it .####[([10, 11, 12], 'NEU')]
I also made a recovery USB stick .####[([4, 5, 6], 'NEU')]
Being a PC user for many years to switch to a Mac I will not go back .####[]
But with this laptop , the bass is very weak and the sound comes out sound tinny .####[([6], 'NEG'), ([12], 'NEG'), ([15], 'NEG')]
I do admit it is pricey but the saying is really true with this MacBook Pro Laptop You get what you pay for .####[]
I 've almost have bought every generation of MacMinis since 2005 , and this one has n't let me down .####[]
The built quality is really good , I was so Happy and excited about this Product .####[([1, 2], 'POS')]
I am loving the fast performance also .####[([5], 'POS')]
I had to return it because it would n't even start .####[]
Further , this Mac Mini has a sloppy Bluetooth interface courtesy of the Mac OS and the range is poor .####[([8, 9], 'NEG'), ([13, 14], 'NEG'), ([17], 'NEG')]
Great deal on an amazing lap top !####[]
If you start on the far right side and scroll to your left the start menu will automatically come up .####[([14, 15], 'NEU')]
Best money I ever spent .####[]
My only gripe would be the need to add more RAM .####[([10], 'NEG')]
But I did n't want to spend another thousand on a laptop since my work already provides me with a PC .####[]
Fine if you have a touch screen .####[([5, 6], 'NEU')]
can never go wrong with apple products .####[]
As far as user type , I dabble in everything from games WoW to Photoshop , but nothing professionally .####[([11], 'NEU'), ([14], 'NEU')]
It doesnt get hot like my PC , with technology always at the tip of our fingertips anytime I forget how to do something i just google it .####[]
I re-seated the "WLAN" card inside and re-installed the LAN device drivers .####[([3, 4], 'NEU'), ([9, 10, 11], 'NEU')]
This by far beats any computer out on the market today built well , battery life AMAZING .####[([11], 'POS'), ([14, 15], 'POS')]
I have n't used it for anything high tech yet , but I love it already .####[]
The OS is easy , and offers all kinds of surprises .####[([1], 'POS')]
I had to get Apple Customer Support to correct the problem .####[([4, 5, 6], 'NEU')]
Ideal for someone on the go or for a high school students .####[]
A veryimportant feature is Firewire 800 which in my experience works better then USB3 in PC enabled with USB3 was not originally sold on the MAC OS I felt it was inferior in many ways To Windows 7 .####[([4, 5], 'POS'), ([13], 'NEG'), ([18], 'NEG'), ([25, 26], 'NEG'), ([36, 37], 'POS')]
I like iTunes , the apparent security , the Mini form factor , all the nice graphics stuff .####[([2], 'POS'), ([6], 'POS'), ([9, 10, 11], 'POS'), ([16, 17], 'POS')]
The first time I used the card reader it took half an hour and a pair of tweezers to remove the card .####[([6, 7], 'NEG'), ([19, 20, 21], 'NEG')]
This flaw unfortunately detracts from everything else Apple got right with the Mini .####[]
After replacing the spinning hard disk with an ssd drive , my mac is just flying .####[([3, 4, 5], 'NEU'), ([8, 9], 'POS')]
I know some people complained about HDMI issues but they released a firmware patch to address that issue .####[([6], 'NEU'), ([12, 13], 'NEU')]
With the needs of a professional photographer I generally need to keep up with the best specs .####[([16], 'NEU')]
Added an iMac about 2 years later .####[]
packing and everything was perfect####[([0], 'POS')]
I will not hesitate to recommend it to family and friends####[]
I called Toshiba where I gave them the serial number and they informed me that they were having issues with the mother boards .####[([21, 22], 'NEU')]
I seem to be having repeat problems as the Mother Board in this one is diagnosed as faulty , related to the graphics card .####[([9, 10], 'NEG'), ([22, 23], 'NEG')]
It also comes with 4G of RAM but if you 're like me you want to max that out so I immediately put 8G of RAM in her and I 've never used a computer that performs better .####[([4, 5, 6], 'NEU'), ([23, 24, 25], 'NEU'), ([36], 'POS')]
This computer is also awesome for my sons virtual home schooling .####[([8, 9, 10], 'POS')]
Cost is more as compared to other brands .####[([0], 'NEG')]
also excellent operating system size and weight for optimal mobility excellent durability of the battery the functions provided by the trackpad is unmatched by any other brand- .####[([2, 3, 4], 'POS'), ([6], 'POS'), ([9], 'POS'), ([11, 12, 13, 14], 'POS'), ([16, 17, 18, 19, 20], 'POS')]
This hardware seems to be better than the iMac in that it is n't $ 1400 and smaller .####[([1], 'POS')]
I 'm done with WinDoze computers .####[]
I 've had it for about 2 months now and found no issues with software or updates .####[([14], 'NEU'), ([16], 'NEU')]
the latest version does not have a disc drive .####[([7, 8], 'NEU')]
Screen , although some people might complain about low res which I think is ridiculous .####[([0], 'POS'), ([9], 'POS')]
